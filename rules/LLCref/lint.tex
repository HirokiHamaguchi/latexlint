\begin{theorem}\label{thm:sample}
	This is a sample theorem.
\end{theorem}

Use \cref{thm:sample} with cref instead of Thm. \ref{thm:sample} with ref to avoid mistakes.
Disabled by default.

\begin{algorithm}
	\caption{Sample Algorithm}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\State First line \label{line:1}
		\State Second line \label{myline:2}
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

In the pseudocode, cleveref can fail to appropriately reference lines.
Thus, we don't detect \verb|\ref{line:1}| like this: Line~\ref{line:1}.
We detect other formats \verb|\ref{myline:2}| like this: Line~\ref{myline:2}.
You can change these behaviors via settings.
