    27: You can always call through the full path. That is always why in past classes if you want to run something on the terminal you've had to do \keyword{./exe} because typically the directory that you are working in is not in the \keyword{PATH} variable. The \keyword{.} expands to your current directory and your shell executes \keyword{\textless{}current\_dir\textgreater{}/exe} which is a valid command.

   146: 
   147: Each process gets its own dictionary of environment variables that are copied over to the child. Meaning, if the parent changes their environment variables it won't be transferred to the child and vice versa. This is important in the fork-exec-wait trilogy if you want to exec a program with different environment variables than your parent (or any other process).

   699: A pipe gets filled up when the writer writes too much to the pipe without the reader reading any of it. When the pipes become full, all writes fail until a read occurs. Even then, a write may partially fail if the pipe has a little bit of space left but not enough for the entire message. Usually, two things are done to avoid this. Either increase the size of the pipe. Or more commonly, fix your program design so that the pipe is constantly being read from.

So what do you need to know is a few things. First, create your repository with the repo creator. If you haven't already signed into enterprise GitHub, make sure to do so otherwise your repository won't be created for you. After that, your repository is created on the server. Git is a decentralized version control system, meaning that you'll need to get a repository onto your VM. We can do this with a clone. Whatever you do, \textbf{do not go through the README.md tutorial}.

For instance, we are more likely to remember the two people we met who took 7~years to graduate than the six others who graduated in four years. Instead of looking at the most unusual cases, we should examine a sample of many cases that represent the population.

If you are unfamiliar with the cards in a regular deck, please see the footnote.\footnote{The 52 cards are split into four \term{suits}: $\clubsuit$ (club), {\color{redcards}$\diamondsuit$} (diamond), {\color{redcards}$\heartsuit$} (heart), $\spadesuit$ (spade). Each suit has its 13 cards labeled: \resp{2}, \resp{3}, ..., \resp{10}, \resp{J} (jack), \resp{Q} (queen), \resp{K} (king), and \resp{A} (ace). Thus, each card is a unique combination of a suit and a label, e.g. {\color{redcards}\resp{4$\heartsuit$}} and \resp{J$\clubsuit$}. The 12 cards represented by the jacks, queens, and kings are called \termsub{\resp{face cards}}{face card}. The cards that are {\color{redcards}$\diamondsuit$} or {\color{redcards}$\heartsuit$} are typically colored {\color{redcards}red} while the other two suits are typically colored black.}

The response variable, \var{spam}, has been encoded to take value~0 when a message is not spam and~1 when it is spam. Our task will be to build an appropriate model that classifies messages as spam or not spam using email characteristics coded as predictor variables. While this model will not be the same as those used in large-scale spam filters, it shares many of the same features.

    37: Aside from the equation-searchable special function databases, which were mentioned in the main paper (DLMF, Wolfram Alpha), there are some keyword-searchable special function databases.  One example is the Wolfram Functions website, where a special function's entry can contain many different definitions and written forms.  A keyword by which to search for more such sites is ``Digital Mathematics Library'' (DML).

    39: There is also an in-development upgrade to searching special functions and orthogonal polynomials, which includes the content of the DLMF and a number of special functions textbooks.  It is planned to be easily searchable \cite{DRMF-CohlEtAl}; since it aims to improve upon the DLMF, hopefully this will include a math-aware search engine which can parse equation queries.  Community comments on each formula's page will also be possible.  A demo of it is available at \cite{DRMF-web-Xsede} or \cite{DRMF-web-wmflabs}.

    18: The search engines are still developing, having been made primarily in the past decade or so. \cite{Guidi-Cohen-2015}  They are well-enough developed to be useful, by providing a new window into our existing research.  As an encyclopedia editor said: ``we don't even know how much we don't know we know''. \cite{Hazewinkel-MKM-is-needed} These search engines help us find what we already know, by enabling us to search in one of our main languages: that of math.

    24: Meaning-based search, on the other hand, could ideally match $\sin(x)$ to $(1/2) i (e^{-iz}-e^{iz})$. \cite{Liska-PhD-Prop, Oviedo-Th, Wolfram-Alpha-web}  However, at present, search engines' knowledge of such math equivalencies vary \cite{Guidi-Cohen-2015} and all fall short of being able to match formulas based just on their meaning, ignoring their notation. \cite{Liska-PhD-Prop, MWS-05-2012} A clear delimitation of what they can recognize would require a full understanding of their mathematics parsing algorithms, and is beyond the scope of this paper.  However, a few limitations and examples are explicitly stated in the search engines' publications, and are included in this paper (Chapter \ref{chap:extent-abilities}).  One simple example of what they can parse is commutativity: $ab$ equals $ba$.  Beyond that simple relation, the two web-available meaning-based search engines vary in their abilities.  One can parse all mathematical equivalencies which \emph{Mathematica} can (Wolfram Alpha) \cite{Weisstein-Alpha}, which is still limited when trying to recognize special functions (such as that $T_n(z) = \frac{\delta_{n,0}}{2} + \frac{n}{2}\sum^{\lfloor (n/2) \rfloor}_{k=1} \frac{(-1)^k (n-k-1)! (2 z)^{n-2k}}{k! (n-2 k)!} + 2^{n-1} z^n /; n \in \mathbb{N}$ \cite{Cheb-I-WF} and $T_n(x) = \cos(n \cos^{-1}(x))$ \cite{Cheb-I-WA} are the same function).  Another (MathWebSearch) allows associativity, lets variables' names vary using wildcards, and generalizes some functions to $f(x)$ notation. \cite{MWS-thesis-hasegan, IancuEtAl2014, MWS-05-2012}  However, this engine does not parse all math to a standardized, mathematically-equivalent form: a search for $\lambda x (1 - x + 1 - 1)$ retrieves different results, for example, than does a search for $\lambda x (1 - x)$.  Math-aware search developers are investigating improving their mathematical comparison abilities with Computer Algebra Systems (such as \emph{Mathematica}): the CAS could be used to simplify all database and queried expressions to a standard notation, using rules of math and definitions of functions, so that equations with different writings but the same meaning could be much better found.  \cite{Oviedo-Th, Liska-PhD-Prop}

    32: It has been said, prior to the start of engines' development (roughly a decade ago), that it is easier to re-derive a medium-difficulty result in math than it is to find it in the literature. \cite{Hazewinkel-MKM-is-needed} The author commented that the same could probably be said for applied mathematics disciplines, of which physics is one.  There is much lying around in the literature which each researcher knows little or nothing about.  To find out what we already know, find connections between systems, discover solutions, and target searches and collaborations, the math-aware search engines fill a long-empty niche.  Interdisciplinary and intra-field information finding becomes simpler, because researchers don't have to know the field's jargon to find information: we can search using formulae, instead, to get a starting point.

    36: Applications to the research of physics, from these search engines, are numerous - some proposed ones are included in Chapter \ref{chap:physics-applications}.  Readers who just want to use the engines can skip Chapter \ref{chap:extent-abilities}, which details the engines' math comparison abilities, limitations, and future developments.  Successful searches and choice of engine are among the subjects overviewed in Chapter \ref{chap:guide-to-use}, which is a quick ``Guide to Use''.  Following that is a usage-oriented summary of each math-aware search engine which is presently web-hosted, in Chapter \ref{chap:avail-SEs}.  That chapter also summarizes the web-available engines' downloadable versions (when applicable), from which custom databases can be created.  Furthermore, it presents a CERN project which is underway, to create math-aware search which is catered to physics' particular needs.  In chapter \ref{chap:screenshots}, screenshots of searches with each search engine are included.

    42: Meaning-based searches, alone, can hit directly upon the deep connections which math notation hides.  In this sense, they are far more useful for branching between fields of physics and/or math, and for (eventually) algorithmically searching for patterns between the phenomena which math represents.  They help researchers to gain better understanding of what the system is actually doing, by changing the human construct imposed upon it by the math: this can help the researcher to separate the system from the mathematical formulations.
    43:

    45: A small experiment \cite{Pres-vs-Content-2014} found that presentation-based search engines provided better results than did meaning-based engines for the following types of equations: elementary functions (such as logarithm), and equations which have only one way of being written (excluding, for example, certain trigonometric expressions).  Special functions which have a standardized representation, such as the Legendre-Q function, were suggested to be equally well-matched by presentation-based and meaning-based search engines.  Equations which have multiple written forms were found to be better-matched by meaning-based search engines; examples include trigonometric expressions and certain special functions (e.g. Hermite-H, Poly-Gamma).

As with Google, these equation-based search engines may relax the query if the equations can not be found to occur in the same document: as does MIaS \cite{SojkaEtAl2011}, they might require only one or more of the multiple query equations to be found in the paper.

    26: 
>   27: \subsection{Design Models and Match them with Physical Systems}
    28: Finding mathematical models which are useful for a case can be done by first coming up with a model which is reasonable but hard to solve, then researching ways to make it more tractable.  The first model which one comes up with need not, then, be the best model: searching the literature can locate refinements which make it more solvable.  This might include avoiding the equation in question by changing the modeling setup, rewriting the equation into an equivalent but manageable format, or making approximations which other researchers have found to work well.  Context will need to be considered, of course, but having this start at discovering better models is priceless.  Keyword-based search engines can help with this, but they are inherently limited by varying terminologies between fields (i.e. jargon) and the need to know what kind of systems one wants to find.  These equation-based search engines enable researchers to find mathematical models using the most appropriate language: that of math.  They already know some of the ``synonyms'' of math (such as $a+b = b+a$), and will only improve with time.

    31: Other times, we find it useful to experiment with analogous systems to ones which we can not directly observe.  For instance, an investigation occurred into Black Holes and their particle production via an analogous system: dumb holes. \cite{Unruh-Dumb-Holes}  These sound-based analogues of black holes were experimented upon to better understand and predict black holes' behaviours. \cite{Experiment-Dumb-Holes, Carroll-Dumb-Holes}  Another set of experiments has been pursued in order to explore additional fundamental predictions of quantum field theory, such as the Sauter-Schwinger effect; \cite{Schuetzhold-fund-experiments} discusses them in a colloquium.
    32:

    34: Another application of finding analogous systems is to explore what physical theories might connect systems which are found to be analogous.  For instance, one might find patterns for merging gravitation with quantum physics, by searching physics publications for quantum or gravity equations.  While this application is limited, so far (because the math-aware search engines are not yet advanced enough to identify mathematically-equivalent notation), it still provides an excellent start.

    37: The form in which an equation is written can have significance.  For example, writing the Schrodinger equation as a probability current indicates that it might be under study as a fluid flow. While this particular format has a name (``probability current''), not all significant formats of equations have a name.  These un-named equations can be difficult to look up - as can some of the named ones - without knowing the jargon of the field.  Math-language search engines let researchers get around the jargon, during the search phase.

    58: Especially when doing interdisciplinary research, it is easy for a researcher to come across notation which he or she is unfamiliar with.  The context is not always explained adequately, in the text, for that researcher to easily find the notation's meaning: field's conventions and ``common knowledge'' are often not stated in publications. \cite{DavenportEtAl2003, Rec-and-retrieval-rev}  Math-aware search engines which use equations' structure (i.e. ``Presentation-based'') to search for results can be used to find more information about the unfamiliar notation.  For example, the search engine ``Tangent'' proposes this application as a use of its software for both students and researchers \cite{Tangent-thesis}; for students, they give the example that the binomial coefficient's notation ($^4_2$) could be drawn in $m_{in}$ (section \ref{sec:min-description}) and subsequently searched for \cite{Tangent-pub-2015,Wangari-et-al_2014_paper}.  For researchers, an application might be to look up why $\pi(2) = 1$, which applies when discussing the ``prime counting function''. \cite{Wangari-et-al_2014_paper}

    84: Writing an equation in a new way can also elucidate paths towards solving it.

Finding other researchers' writings of an equation gives the researcher an opportunity to see what other forms of writing other researchers might have found useful: it gives them direction towards finding a potential solution.

    88: Improvements to this application are possible with certain feature developments in the math-aware search engine.  For instance, if the results could be \emph{ranked according to solvability} - that is, whether an equation can and/or has been solved analytically (or numerically, in an efficient manner) - then researchers could find ways of writing their equation such that solutions fall out easily.  This goes beyond \emph{Mathematica}, since even \emph{Mathematica} (and similar software) sometimes needs equations to be written in different representations in order to solve them.  Furthermore, \emph{Mathematica} can not change how the mathematical model is attached to the physical world (e.g. is $x$ the linear distance from a point, or the distance along a curved wire?), which a researcher who views equation results could do.  When a researcher searches existing models, the searcher can also see what assumptions were useful to those models, and decide whether they can apply to the system at hand; \emph{Mathematica} requires many such assumptions to be included as input to the equation.  Finding information in the literature can therefore be of benefit beyond what \emph{Mathematica}-like systems provide, for solving equations.  If these search engines could determine whether a given equation format is solvable, or read that data from the document which includes it, then finding solvable mathematical models (or just equations) in the literature becomes easier.

>  193: \section{The visitors' impressions} \label{sec4} Multimedia installations and interwoven threads were not the only factors of success for the first set-up of the exhibition \textit{MadeInMath}. The animators were of crucial importance because they were mediators between organizers and visitors. Master students in various degrees in science (Mathematics, Biology, Physics, etc.) have been trained on the topics covered by the exhibition to accompany the many school-groups, but also to follow individual visitors, or small groups of hesitant visitors. For animators it was undoubtedly a formative moment for their training and their personal growth. Each of them, in fact, was free to propose their reading of the contents of the exhibition because the exhibition has various interpretations and visits had different cuts. People reported that they visited it twice and had different impressions each time. The ability to create connections between seemingly unrelated issues is one of the most powerful activity of mathematics, which gave the show an edge. It was thanks to all these facets that each visitor could grasp interesting aspects depending on their age, their training and their own interests. As commented in \cite{tg} by one of the animators, Maurizio Giaffredo, each of us animators took away a wealth of meetings and reflections whose value derives from the diversity of people and ideas that we had the chance to meet. In just two weeks the exhibition was visited by over 40,000 visitors. Of these, about 18,000 were students, mostly from middle and  high school. This means that more than half of the visitors fall into the category `general public`, which was quite a success. Beyond the figures, it was impressive to experience a high level of satisfaction by visitors. An initial indicator in this regard was to see students on a visit with the class during the week and then see them again at the weekend with their parents or other friends to illustrate some of the content of the exhibition as if they were young guides. A second indicator comes from the evidence left by visitors. Let us quote some of the thousands that people delighted in leaving. One of them says: "We knew the beauty of mathematics, but we did not suspect that  it was so beautiful. Thank you also for the love and attention to the teacher's figure". In fact, part of the exhibition gave space to the admirable work done every day by teachers, in this case those of mathematics. We were particularly pleased that this aspect has been apprehended and appreciated. Further evidence comes from some foreign visitors, who wrote: "I wish I had paid more attention to math class!" indicating the fact that the exhibition has managed to somehow overcome the misconception regarding mathematics and bring in the foreground some of the fundamental aspects of the teaching of mathematics (but not only), such as curiosity, wonder and the transmission of important ideas and not only tedious techniques. In this regard, a visitor wrote that he/she discovered a new world. In this sense, the initial disorientation was overcome in an unexpected and positive way because the exhibition succeeded in unveiling the potential of mathematics, which previously seemed unattainable. Another witness is grateful for the many ideas and so many hints that would be used at school for events on the subject of mathematics. There have also been some criticism, sometimes because of the difficulty in understanding certain topics. For this, as we discussed before, the guides were really fundamental because they played a role as a cultural mediator. The comments regarding some guides have been very positive, as, for example, "The exhibition is very beautiful but the enthusiasm of our guide was exceptional". Finally, we would like to quote a comment by a visitor, probably very young, that after the visit wrote that the exhibition was better than \textit {Gardaland} (an amusement park)!

    69: Meaning-based search algorithms attempt to find equations which math the mathematical meaning of the searched-for (``queried'') equation. \cite{Pres-vs-Content-2014, Liska-PhD-Prop, MWS-05-2012} Each uses a different approach, and all fall short of being able to fully identify mathematical equivalencies given different writings of the math (including Wolfram Alpha).  Nevertheless, they are able to identify mathematical equivalencies to varying degrees.

  message: Should this be "Database Expansion"? Follow your preferred style guide and register as an exception if necessary.
   171: Field experts have indicated that more of the search engines need to focus on extracting mathematical meaning (including context and symbols' meanings) from documents. \cite{AizawaEtAl2014} Algorithms with which to extract theorems from publications, and to restrict searches to formulas which are consistent with a query's mathematical assumptions, are also desired. \cite{MWS-05-2012}  It is being explored to allow the user to define which parts of a formula should be kept fixed, when searching for results, and which are allowed to bring up ``similar'' results (see ``simto'' regions, \cite{ntcir12mathIR}).  There is also work being done to improve the identification of equations which share the same mathematical meaning, but are written differently. \cite{Liska-PhD-Prop, Oviedo-Th} Precision of results and recall speeds are other areas of improvement; the recall speed is only a few seconds at most, but that is still slower than standard text-based search engines.  \cite{Guidi-Cohen-2015} Unbiased evaluation metrics are also recommended, to allow rigorous comparison of the math-aware search engines. \cite{Guidi-Cohen-2015} Finally, scalability is a target area of advancement, with the eventual goal of covering the entire web. \cite{Tangent-pub-2015}

The DLMF is also exploring ways to improve or enlarge their special function content (for which they are soliciting community feedback - see ``news'' section of \cite{DLMF-website}). Formalized math libraries (e.g. Mizar) and theorem proving libraries (e.g. Thousands of Problems for Theorem Proving) are also having math-aware search added to them. \cite{MWS-05-2012}

   204: Doing so would require first obtaining this information, likely by adding a step to the pre-processing of documents in these databases.  One possible, but probably time-intensive, way to do so would simply be to attempt to solve every one of the database documents' equations in Mathematica, or a similar program.  However, the choice of input parameters would need to be decided upon.  Even an approximate measure of how solvable an equation is would - in general - be better than having a list of unranked equation search results.  Another possible method is to try to extract the information about an equation's solvability from the text or equations of any document which contains that exact written form of the equation; this includes searching mathematical encyclopedias, educational resources, and any other available documents.  This, too, would require a lot of development to be fully implemented.

   218: \label{sssec:comp-speedup-future-dev}
   219: Some computations can be done analytically, using Mathematica or similar software.  (Which ones can be done this way is limited by the computation time and ability of the software platform.)  Computations which are done this way often produce secondary equations during run-time: that is, they combine or solve a set of equations, then try to combine it with a second set of equations.  One of the secondary equations can slow down the program's run-time enough that it becomes impractical.  If that equation can be replaced, during run-time, with a faster-solving rewriting of it, then the problem of its slow-down can be fixed.  That replacement could be done by making a run-time call to a ``search engine'' for math equations, which obtains a faster-solving mathematical representation for the problematic equation.

    97: Recent advances in LLMs offer a host of possibilities aimed to enhance learning, including furnishing explanatory feedback to learners \citep{dai2023can}, with prompt engineering of models leaning towards more of an art than a science \citep{wei2022chain}. Among these, Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models, particularly the latest iteration, GPT-4, exhibits notable improvements over GPT-3.5. GPT-4 excels in tackling more complex tasks, learns faster, and demonstrates reduced potential for biased or offensive responses \citep{openai}. However, it suffers from slower response and generation times, presenting a notable challenge in handling large transcriptions. Despite its advancements, GPT-4 comes at a considerably higher cost of \$0.03/1K tokens compared to GPT-3.5, which costs \$0.0015/1K tokens for input, marking a 20-fold increase in expense \citep{openai}. Considering the speed and cost-effectiveness of GPT-3.5, our focus lies in evaluating its suitability for assessing tutor performance in practical, real-world tutoring settings. To this end, we aim to investigate the following research questions: \textbf{RQ1}: Can large language models accurately assess components of effective human tutors’ responses to students making errors? \textbf{RQ2}: What is the comparative accuracy and performance between GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 in assessing tutoring dialogues for how tutors respond to students making errors?

We adopt the few-shot templates from OpenCompass \citep{2023opencompass}. We use majority voting \citep{wang2023selfconsistency} accuracy as the metric.

InternLM2-Math-Base models outperform their initial checkpoints InternLM2-Base on both benchmarks which shows the effectiveness of continue pre-training.

    32: \paragraph{$\bullet$ Context-unaware} The absence of context $C$ poses a unique challenge for assessing ChatGPT's math problem generation capabilities. Nonetheless, this scenario is essential, as teachers often seek to prompt language models like ChatGPT for math questions without prior context. To address this, we manually collect math curricula for three pre-university levels and propose a prompting framework to create \dataset, a novel dataset with $16K$ question-answer pairs spanning $121$ pre-university math topics and $428$ lessons. Our evaluation of \dataset\ provides valuable insights into ChatGPT's math question generation capability.

    35: \subsection{Fine-tuning Baselines} We fine-tune the baselines to generate the question $Q$, given the context $C$ with or without the expected answer $A$ by concatenating the input in the format: \texttt{Context: C} [with/without] \texttt{Answer: A}. The model then learns to generate $Q$.

    18: Recently, LLMs have shown remarkable zero-shot and few-shot abilities in various language generation contexts \cite{brown2020language, wei2022finetuned, ouyang2022training}. However, they still face challenges in more complex tasks like mathematical reasoning \cite{gao2022pal, imani2023mathprompter}, often requiring expensive computational resources for fine-tuning. To address this, researchers have been exploring novel prompting methods to instruct LLMs in these tasks, including chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting \cite{weichain}. This enables LLMs to perform intermediate reasoning steps, significantly enhances LLMs' reasoning abilities, especially for complex mathematical and decision-making tasks.

>   20: \subsection{Pre-university Math Problems Generation}\label{ssec:related-math-problem}
    21: Pre-university math problems have received increasing attention from the AI research community, with benchmarks such as SVAMP \cite{svamp} for elementary-level math, secondary school-level GSM8K \cite{cobbe2021training} offers diverse solution templates, and the MATH \cite{hendrycks2021measuring} dataset provides complex reasoning for tertiary/olympiad problems along with step-by-step solutions. Recently, interest has grown in other tertiary math topics like geometry problems and mathematical theorem proving \cite{sachan-etal-2019-discourse, chen-etal-2022-unigeo}. Additionally, automatic question generation (QG) in education has gained attention for enhancing teaching activities \cite{Kurdi2019ASR}. Additionally, in education, QG has gained attention with the use of LLMs, particularly ChatGPT, has gained significant interest for generating practice questions in various subjects \cite{Wang2022TowardsHE, Kasneci2023ChatGPTFG}. However, its potential for generating pre-university mathematics problems remains largely unexplored. This study, therefore, evaluates ChatGPT's performance using three well-established datasets: SVAMP, GSM8K, and MATH, covering pre-university grades and various difficulty levels.

   685: \paragraph{(3) ChatGPT generates questions with difficulty solely depending on the difficulty of demonstration.} When presented with a straightforward example (level 3) but tasked with generating a more complex question (level 5), ChatGPT often replicates the initial demonstration and struggles to enhance the question's difficulty. We noticed that lessons with overlapping content between secondary school and high school levels were generated similarly because of the shared demonstration, despite distinct required difficulty levels in the prompt. This pattern was consistently observed in all our attempts to generate questions with varying difficulty levels from the provided demonstrations.

>  687: \paragraph{(4) If ChatGPT generates hard questions, it could not handle the complexity and generates nonsense.} ChatGPT demonstrates proficiency in introducing new objects within questions but struggles to establish meaningful connections or inquire about genuine relationships between these objects. For instance, in Geometry questions, ChatGPT often generates random points (A, B, C), states some relationships (e.g., AX is the bisector of angle BAC), and includes unrelated quantitative properties (e.g., angle AXB = angle AXC), resulting in suboptimal performance.

   259: All of the above is a bunch of examples showing what is math useful to us as a species, as a community. But of course, we may ask ourselves if math knowledge should not be simply limited to mathematicians, engineers abd other people who may use it in their work for the benefit of the community at large. After all, we do not need people know exactly how a bridge is constructed, how a TV works, or how to repair a broken engine. For that, we use people who know how to do. Why should math be different?

   319: Politicians are informed real-time about the hottest arguments of discussion (\textit{trending topics}) and on what most people think about the argument (\textit{sentiment analysis}), and so they are ready to band-wagon on the hottest topic with the coolest opinion. It almost does not matter whether the opinions expressed are coherent with one another or not: what is really important is to say something on the trending topic of the day, with their opinion being shared and viewed by the highest possible number of people. In time of election, people will recognise your name, and you'll have bigger chances of being voted, hence more votes. This is the core of marketing, applied to politics. Not so great if you think politics should be about solving the community's problems, but that's how it is. And there is a lot of math in that.

   322: So, we have decided that politicians' biggest task is getting elected (even if they are really interested in doing their work for the benefit of the community: in order to do that, they need to be elected). Alas, the outcome of elections is far from being determined from what voters think, and the electoral system is crucial for the result. This is exactly the reason why politicans spend so much time discussing the electoral system. This subsection is mainly based on my paper \cite{SS}, on mathematical paradoxes of elections. I refer the reader to that paper  for greater details.

    63: In this section, we showcase some examples of different subjects of MMMU demanding sophisticated college-level domain knowledge. Figure~\ref{fig:mmmu_graph_theory}, Figure~\ref{fig:mmmu_group_theory}, and Figure~\ref{fig:mmmu_operation_research} present the subject of Graph Theory, Group Theory, and Operation Research, respectively. Moreover, typical examples of Topology and Graph Theory in our~\datasetname~are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:ours_graph_theory_3_example} and Figure~\ref{fig:ours_graph_theory_3_example}. Although both sets of subjects are intricate mathematical disciplines, they exhibit notable differences in the nature of their posed questions. Questions in the MMMU dataset often involve advanced college-level mathematical concepts such as Kruskal’s algorithm, alternating group structures, and DFS Spanning Tree. In contrast, the questions in our dataset predominantly comprise puzzles that are readily solvable by middle and high school students.

>  110: \paragraph{MM-MATH presents substantial challenges for current LMMs} From the evaluation results, we find that the most representative closed-source model to date, GPT-4o, performed the best across the board, achieving an average accuracy of 31.8\%, which significantly outperformed the best open-source model, InternVL-4B-Chat-1.5, with an average accuracy of 11.6\%. However, compared to the human-level baseline of 80.4\%, this best performance of the LMM still remains substantial room for improvement by 48.6\%.

For example, there are differences of 4.2\%, 2.7\%, and 0.8\% for the models GPT-4o, GPT-4v, and Claude-3-Opus, respectively. This result suggests that current LMMs primarily rely on linguistic knowledge to solve mathematical problems, and their utilization of visual contexts is limited. Detailed case studies are provided in Appendix~\ref{text reasoning}.

This result indicates that the proposed evaluation dimensions exhibit a significant differentiation across three difficulty levels, making it more beneficial for exploring the capability shortcomings of models. In addition, the three types of knowledge points also provide us with opportunities to understand the capabilities of models from different fine-grained perspectives.

Intriguingly, among closed-source LMMs---GPT-4o, GPT-4V, Claude-3-Opus, Gemini-Pro-V, and Qwen-VL-Max---the proportion of errors in image recognition are highly consistent, around 57\%.

Misuse or omission of theorems misleads these LMMs, leading to errors (e.g., GPT-4V misuses the cosine rule, resulting in no solution, as detailed in Appendix~\ref{Misapplication of Theorems}). 
   163: Unlike image understanding, we find that a larger model size effectively helps reduce reasoning errors in the model.

This suggests that the text-based capabilities of LMMs are not the bottleneck in solving multimodal mathematical problems. Instead, we should focus more on fine-grained recognition and reasoning of visual content to enhance the capabilities of LMMs.

I (Wilson) am currently advocating for the value of what I call “a choreographic way of seeing”: sharing the ``How'' of training the eye to perceive what is actually there.  Last winter, I co-taught  a \href{https://africana.sas.upenn.edu/node/7963}{graduate seminar} at the University of Pennsylvania with \href{https://anthropology.sas.upenn.edu/people/deborah-a-thomas}{Deborah Thomas} (UPenn, Dept. of Anthropology) on  kinesthetic anthropology, focusing on my particular understanding of Choreographic Time, Space and Movement.  Working with scholars and scientists has clarified the value of this training and ability not only for choreographers, but also with potential application across many disciplines.

   485: The question generation pipeline described in Section~\ref{sec:method} was developed through an iterative process of refining prompts and design choices, and evaluating their impact on the quality of the final questions and solutions. Notably, the inclusion of the \textit{attempted solution} and \textit{question validation} steps significantly enhanced the pipeline's effectiveness. Despite the sophistication of the pipeline and prompts, we still observe instances where models fail to follow the given instructions. This section highlights prominent failure modes at various stages of the pipeline, which human raters need to be aware of. Additionally, we explore some intriguing behaviors of the models where they successfully create interesting and creative questions. Section~\ref{subsec:human-AI} details the role of human raters in improving these questions.

This allows us to account for cases where incorrect reasoning traces lead to a correct final answer. Appendix~\ref{app:prompt_eval} shows the prompt used for evaluation. During response generation, we set the temperature to 0 and top\_p to 1 for all models. All necessary compute details are discussed in Appendix~\ref{app:expts}%For open source LLMs, 2 80GB A100 GPUs and 72GB of RAM to run inference facilitated by vLLM~\citep{kwon2023efficient}.

This observation may be explained as follows - Math specialist models such as the MAmmoTH \cite{mammoth} and MetaMath \cite{metamath} series of models are often obtained by finetuning pre-trained models on large corpuses of synthetically generated data in a supervised manner. These synthetic datasets such as the MetaMathQA \cite{metamath} and MathInstruct \cite{mammoth} are seeded using smaller datasets such as Math \cite{math} and GSM8k \cite{gsm8k}, for eg. by asking generative models to generate questions \textit{similar} to the questions in these small datasets.

For instance, a trigonometry question might omit necessary angles or distances, (c) \textit{Unsolvable or Computationally Intractable Questions}: Some questions generated are either unsolvable or require excessive brute-force calculations, which are impractical for evaluating reasoning abilities, (d) \textit{Nonsensical Questions}: Models sometimes produce questions that are logically inconsistent, confusing, or ambiguous, such as a probability problem with unclear parameters or an impossible geometry scenario, (e) \textit{Deceitful Solutions}: Occasionally, models fabricate solutions to nonsensical or unsolvable questions, presenting incorrect logic as plausible reasoning and (f) \textit{Finding a Needle in the Haystack}: Long and complex validation prompts sometimes cause models to confuse or overlook the specified skills, leading to incorrect evaluations. 
   620: 
>  621: \paragraph{Insufficient involvement of skills.} Despite clearly specifying that solving the question should necessarily require a rigorous application of both skills, the models often generate questions that either miss one of the skills completely or require a very shallow application of one (while the other one is sufficiently involved) or both skills. This is the most prominent failure mode of the models in the context of question generation. This leads to potentially easy questions, defeating the purpose of skill composition. Consider the question given below which was generated by Claude Opus when asked to combine the skills \texttt{ratio\_and\_proportion} and \texttt{geometry}. \\

   627: Upon careful examination of the question, we note that although the question tests \texttt{geometry}, the involvement of \texttt{ratio\_and\_proportions} is practically non-existent. Further, the question validation step in some cases also fails to identify these flaws. Supplying multi-turn human-AI interactions where the user prompts a chatbot to generate a question combining two skills, in-context during the generation step helps the models to avoid such questions to a certain extent. Further, to make the question validation step more robust to such questions, we prompt the model to ensure that the complexity of each skill application in the question being validated in similar to or more than the complexity of these skills in the reference examples present in the skill descriptions. The combination of these two techniques helps us nearly eliminate questions where the absent one of the skills is absent completely and reduce questions involving shallow application of skills to a significant extent.
   628: 
>  629: \paragraph{Insufficient information in the questions.} Another common failure mode of the pipeline is the generated questions missing information or details essential for solving the question. For example in the question given below which is supposed to combine the skills \texttt{understanding\_and\_applying\_floor\_and\_ceiling\_functions} and \texttt{basic\_trigonometry}, lacks sufficient detail about the inclinations and elevations of the paths relative to the streetlight's position which is necessary to answer the question.

   673: While solving this question, the model arrives at the conditions $sin(\theta) = 2$ or $sin(\theta) = -2$. Clearly, these conditions have no solutions since $-1 \leq sin(\theta) \leq 1, \forall \theta \in [0, 2\pi]$. However, the model goes on to argue that the the closest values to 2 and -2 in the range of $\sin(\theta)$ are 1 and -1, and thus, goes on to solve the question for $sin(\theta) = 1$ or $sin(\theta) = -1$.
   674: 
>  675: \paragraph{Finding a needle in the haystack.} In an attempt to make the \textit{question validation} step robust to as many failure modes as possible, we come up with a long and sophisticated prompt (see Appendix~\ref{app:prompt_val} for an example of this prompt). To elaborate, the validation prompt comprises of 1.) skill descriptions consisting of 3 exemplars for each of the 2 skills, 2.) 6 very long validation exemplars 3.) rest of the prompt consisting of the 7 conditions described in Section~\ref{sec:ques_val}. In prior iterations of the validation prompt, the names of the two skills which are supposed to be combined in the question, were mentioned only once throughout the prompt. In such a case, we observed that more often than not, model confused the pair of skills at hand, with skills mentioned in the validation exemplars. We also observed cases where the model was unable to locate the original skill names, came up with its own skill names depending on the skill exemplars provided in the skill descriptions. More specifically, while checking the question for \textbf{Dual Skill Requirement} in Section~\ref{sec:ques_val}, the models would check the question for the presence of skills distinct from the pair of skills at hand. We attribute this phenomenon to the the \textit{lost in the middle} or \textit{finding a needle in the haystack} challenges faced by LLMs. We provide an example of the phenomenon below. Notice how in Point 3 of the reasoning trace the model checks the question for the presence of two completely unrelated skills. We were able to nearly eliminate this problem by replacing referential terms (such as \textit{above given skills}, \textit{these skills}, etc.) to the two skills by the skill names.

This observation may be explained as follows - Math specialist models such as the MAmmoTH \cite{mammoth} and MetaMath \cite{metamath} series of models are often obtained by finetuning pre-trained models on large corpuses of synthetically generated data in a supervised manner. These synthetic datasets such as the MetaMathQA \cite{metamath} and MathInstruct \cite{mammoth} are seeded using smaller datasets such as Math \cite{math} and GSM8k \cite{gsm8k}, for eg. by asking generative models to generate questions \textit{similar} to the questions in these small datasets. This procedure severely limits the diversity of synthetic datasets thereby affecting the generalization abilities of the models finetuned on these datasets.

These synthetic datasets such as the MetaMathQA \cite{metamath} and MathInstruct \cite{mammoth} are seeded using smaller datasets such as Math \cite{math} and GSM8k \cite{gsm8k}, for eg. by asking generative models to generate questions \textit{similar} to the questions in these small datasets.

    43: We next evaluate performance when more highly activating math-specific parameters by scaling the weights by a universal factor.  For smaller models, we find the scalar 1.1 works best, while for larger models (Llama 3.1 8B IT), a smaller factor (1.01) works better. While we leave a rigorous study of this hyperparameter to future work due to its computational expense, see Appendix \ref{sec:hyperparameters} for our experimentation with scale factors. As in Section \ref{deleting_params}, we scale the parameters each method identifies based on 500 random samples from each relevant dataset and repeat the process five times, reporting the parameter proportion that performs best.

An ideal method would fall in the top right of these plots, meaning GSM8K accuracy increases while non-math performance is maintained. As shown in these figures, scaling parameters identified by MathNeuro results in a GSM8K performance increase of 4-17\% across models, while scaling Wanda-identified parameters tends to either harm or slightly improve performance. As with pruning, LAPE performs inconsistently in the scaling setting across models. Scaling random parameters can help for some models, although the effect is not consistent across models. Each parameter identification method does not harm performance on RACE or MMLU, suggesting scaling's impact tends to be localized to math performance. %The GSM8K performance gains from scaling parameters identified by MathNeuro and the lack of catastrophic forgetting are consistent across models and highlight the potential for future work to utilize these parameters for interventions.

We then prune or scale parameters identified by each method and run each experiment five times using different random samples from each dataset.

    69: We next explore if MathNeuro consistently identifies the same parameters as math-specific across different random subsets from a math and non-math dataset. This allows us to identify if math reasoning is in fact reliably concentrated in a subset of model parameters like the experiments above suggest. We first identify math-specific parameters using MathNeuro on two different random subsets from a math and non-math dataset. Next, we calculate the percentage overlap between the parameters identified in both subsets. We do this five times for different sample sizes (1, 10, 100, 500, and 1,000) and for calculating different proportions of top parameters from each dataset. This allows us to construct confidence intervals and see how parameter identification consistency varies when calculating based on different sample sizes and top parameter proportions. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:race_consistency} and Appendix \ref{sec:mmlu_param_location_number}, with 100 or more samples, roughly 95\% or more of the parameters MathNeuro identifies overlap between two random subsets regardless of the proportion of top parameters calculated, which shows that the method is able to consistently identify the most important parameters for math performance and that these parameters are largely invariant with regard to the subset of data used to calculate them.

Wanda then prunes the parameters with the smallest scores. Wanda considers both weights and activations as elements of parameter importance because small but highly activated weights can be highly influential, while large but lightly activated weights may be less influential.

    20: While naively identifying the parameters with the highest absolute value of weights times activations may find parameters important for a given task, it may not isolate the parameters important for that task \textit{only}, as discussed above. Thus, we calculate parameter importance for other unrelated tasks and use the disjoint set between these sets of parameters as the ones that are math-specific, which is the critical innovation of MathNeuro. To do this, we separately sum\footnote{This summation is akin to gradient-based identification methods summing gradients over inputs (e.g., \citealt{das_unified_2023}).} the absolute value of weights times activations for each parameter in attention and MLP layers for each data point $k$ across $N$ samples from a math dataset and an unrelated natural language task dataset. We focus on attention and MLP layers because recent work has found that knowledge and skills are often distributed in these two model components \cite{wei_does_2024, yin_lofit_2024}. Using this formulation, we compute scores for each parameter over math and non-math inputs:

   572: In real-world settings, EPredictor is easy to use in a car. After each DTC occurrence and until reaching a minimum number of observations is reached, we would then infer the most likely EP and its time of occurrence. If the model is confident enough, the user will be alerted to an impending critical fault and directed to a nearby dealer, hence enhancing vehicle safety on the road and reducing maintenance costs.

>  574: \section{CarFormer Pre-training Details}\label{appendix:pretraining}
   575: We trained the CarFormer model for 70,000 steps with a learning rate of \(5 \times 10^{-4}\), scheduled using a cosine warm restart with 10,000 warm-up steps, and a weight decay of 0.1. The loss coefficients were set to \(\alpha = 1\) and \(\beta = 1\). The model architecture included 12 attention heads, 6 layers, and a feature size of 600, utilizing the GELU activation function in all feed-forward layers. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a batch size of 192 and a sequence length of 258, resulting in approximately 34 million parameters. It is important to note that on all experiments we fixed the same number of parameters when introducing news embeddings for all evaluated model to provide a fair comparison, same for Epredictor. The training data was split into $85\%$ training and $15\%$ testing without up-sampling, and random events were injected with a probability of \(p = 0.05\) per sample. On average, each training session lasted about 20 hours on an Nvidia A10G GPU.

>  206: \subsection{Event Sequence Modelling with TPP}
   207: Event data is commonly modelled via Temporal Point Processes (TPPs), which describe stochastic processes of discrete events. Each event is composed of a time of occurrence $t \in \mathbb{R}^+$ and an event type $u \in U$ forming a pair $(t, u)$. $U$ is a finite set of discrete event types.
   208: A sequence is constructed with multiple pairs of events, such as $S = \{(t_1, u_1), ... , (t_L, u_L)\}$ where $0<t_1< ... < t_n$.

>  266: \subsection{Self-supervised learning}
   267: By leveraging an efficient pre-training task (e.g. token masking or next token prediction) and then fine-tuning a smaller model with fewer parameters for specific tasks, Transformer-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing tasks \cite{bert, gpt3}.
   268: For example, the GPT model is pre-trained on the next token prediction task, where the labels are generated by shifting the tokens to the right. Then, a classification head is added on top of the Transformer model to assign a probability to each token. Contrary to BERT \cite{bert} a causal mask is applied so that tokens can only attend to the previous one, thus preventing cheating. In section \ref{sec:pretraining} we will introduce a pre-trained model serving as an encoder trained on specific event prediction tasks to ensure adaptability to the event stream domain of vehicles. We found that modelling event streams with autoregressive Transformer-based models for fault predictions were not addressed well in the literature \cite{nppreview} although there is some related work for TPPs \cite{lin2022exploring, shou2024selfsupervisedcontrastivepretrainingmultivariate}.

For multiple-choice questions, the addition of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and 2-shot examples tend to decrease performance for most models. Specifically, out of the ten models we test, eight models perform best with the original prompt. This suggests that for multiple-choice questions, which typically require selecting an answer from given options, simpler prompts lead to better outcomes as they reduce potential confusion or overthinking induced by extra information.

Notably, only competition-level problems (e.g., Olympiads and AIME/AMC) from NuminaMath are included, as we  observe that  grade-school-level problems do not significantly improve LLM complex math reasoning. To augment the limited  competition-level problems, we follow ~\citep{xwin} and use GPT-4 to synthesize new problems based on the seed problems in 7.5k MATH train set and 3.6k AMC-AIME training split.  However, GPT-4 often generated unsolvable problems or incorrect solutions for challenging seed problems. To filter these, we prompt GPT-4 to generate 10 solutions per problem, retaining only those with at least 3 consistent solutions. %, which are then accepted as the ground truth.

   141: As shown in~\Cref{tab:CoT&shot}, we observe that CoT and few-shot do not always improve model performance on MV-MATH. While Claude performs 3.4\% better with CoT and 1.3\% better with 2-shot based on CoT, GPT4o performs best under CoT with 2-shot setting, while Qwen-vl-max and gpt-4v perform best under CoT setting. For Gemini-1.5-pro and all open-source models, the original versions outperform CoT and CoT with 2-shot prompts. Notably, for all open-source models, performance declines steadily with the introduction of CoT and 2-shot prompting. We conduct further analysis on different types of questions in Appendix, and we find that original prompts perform better for multiple-choice questions, while CoT tends to produce better results for free-form questions. Adding 2-shot on top of CoT tends to degrade model performance on MV-MATH. Similar results are observed in Math-Vision~\cite{mathvision}.
   142: 
>  143: \subsection{Analysis of Question type and Difficulty}
   144: \noindent \textbf{Different Question Types.} We compare the performance of various models on three types of questions. As shown in~\Cref{fig: lidar}(right), the accuracy of the model on multiple-choice questions is significantly higher than on free-form questions. We design two evaluation metrics for multi-step questions: Step Accuracy Rate (\textbf{SAR}) and Question Completeness Rate (\textbf{QCR}). SAR refers to the proportion of correctly answered steps out of the total steps, while QCR is the proportion of questions for which all steps were answered correctly. The model with the best performance on the QCR metric is GPT-4o, achieving only 6\%, while its corresponding SAR is 32.6\%. This reflects the model's insufficient ability to perform complex reasoning on open and multi-step questions, and also reveals that the multiple-choice question format may not truly reflect the model's actual reasoning and problem-solving ability, as they usually rely on prompts to identify options.

   383: An important aspect of reinforcement learning is that the training signal should appropriately attribute the good actions with high rewards and poor actions with low rewards. Therefore, problems with multiple choice answers pose a problem: the model can inadvertently respond with the correct answer option (generally between a 25-50\% chance of guessing correctly) without providing the correct intermediate reasoning steps, leading to a poor learning signal. For this reason, we choose to remove any problems that are multiple choice, True/False, and Yes/No.

Next, we run our filter over the dataset and inspect 100 problems classified as positive examples (multiple choice) and 100 problems classified as negative examples (open-ended). We iteratively add the difficult incorrectly classified problems into the prompt, mostly selecting problems following a previously unseen pattern. For these filters we prioritize a high recall, ensuring that we remove as much undesirable data as possible. In this iterative process of filter development, we continue until achieving over 98\% recall, requiring between 5-8 rounds of manual verification.

For the full analysis of threshold see Appendix~\ref{app:sensitivity_analysis}.

This hybrid design is optimized for scalability, with our model choice empirically justified in Appendix~\ref{app:decontamination_model_choice}, and removed only 4 questions, leaving 16,281 examples.

   117: The use of large language models for math problem solving began with grade- and high-school level mathematics \cite{cobbe2021trainingverifierssolvemath, hendrycks2021measuringmathematicalproblemsolving}. LLMs quickly progressed from solving a handful of problems to saturating the benchmarks due to increased problem-solving abilities \cite{bubeck2023sparksartificialgeneralintelligence}. To address this gap, more challenging benchmarks containing PhD and competition-level mathematics emerged \cite{gulati2025putnamaxiomfunctionalstaticbenchmark, tsoukalas2024putnambenchevaluatingneuraltheoremprovers, glazer2025frontiermathbenchmarkevaluatingadvanced, ai-mathematical-olympiad-prize, ai-mathematical-olympiad-progress-prize-2}. Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), trained with Reinforcement Learning techniques to utilize additional compute at inference-time, quickly rose to this challenge. LRMs from providers like DeepMind \cite{DeepMind2025GeminiGold}, Harmonic \cite{achim2025aristotleimolevelautomatedtheorem}, and OpenAI \cite{openai2025o3o4mini} achieved Gold medal-level performance at the 2025 International Mathematics Olympiad. These accomplishments complement a parallel line of computer-assisted discovery systems (e.g., FunSearch \cite{veličković2024amplifyinghumanperformancecombinatorial}, AlphaTensor \cite{AlphaTensor2022}, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolvecodingagentscientific}), which demonstrated that search, learning, and symbolic tools can together yield novel or improved results. Despite these achievements, these systems share one feature: the solving and discovery models engage in occurs for problems \emph{posed by humans}, and thus they are not evaluated at judging problems.

In our work, we explore whether LLMs' interestingness judgments of the math problems themselves align with peoples' judgements. 
   123: 
>  124: \paragraph{Human interestingness judgments.} Previous work in cognitive science has attempted to build models of what humans find interesting, and ultimately, what drives human curiosity \cite{Loewenstein1994Curiosity, hy_day_curiosity}. Some experiments studied students' reactions to irregular patterns \cite{berlyne1963complexity} and complex shapes \cite{day1967evaluations}, linking how they judged interestingness to complexity, novelty, and incongruity, and how these factors shape exploratory behavior. Studies done within mathematics specifically explore expert appraisals of what makes a proof ``beautiful'' \cite{10.1093/philmat/nku014}. Attempts to build artificially intelligent mathematical systems, including AMD systems such as Graffiti \cite{Colton1999AutomaticCF}, AM \cite{COLTON2000351, Lenat1976AMAA}, HR \cite{Colton1999AutomaticCF, COLTON2000351}, and GT \cite{epstein1987}, operationalized ``interestingness'' via large sets of hand-coded heuristics, which enabled early progress but limited scalability and adaptability across domains. While research in cognitive science has tried to explain how humans judge interestingness, work involving AMD systems often manually imbues these systems with problem features humans deem interesting. While not the primary focus in this work, our data collection and analyses also raise new questions of how people decide what problems are even worth solving~\citep{getzels1982problem, nickles1981problem, chu2025makes, collins2025people, wong2025meta}.  % In our work, we draw on techniques from both cognitive science and artificial intelligence to study how human and LLM judgments of interestingness in math problems compare. %[todo: last sentence needs work]

   153: We study human interestigness judgments in two participant pools and two different banks of problems: (1) crowdsourced participants reasoning about AMC problems, and (2) IMO participants (engaged in-person at the 2024 competition) reasoning about past IMO problems. Both studies received ethics approval by our institutional ethics review boards (the former study through MIT, and the latter through the University of Cambridge).
   154: 
>  155: \paragraph{Crowdsourcing human interestingness judgments.} %We first describe our crowdsourced participant judgements. 
   156: We recruit 63 participants from Prolific, a crowdsourcing platform common in cognitive science~\citep{palan2018prolific}. Each participant was assigned to one of 2 conditions, rating 10 problems each. Each participant saw the same control problems and either a problem's original version or its variant. Participants were required to think about each problem for at least 1 minute before rating its \emph{interestingness} and \emph{difficulty} on a scale of 0-100, and providing a \mbox{1- to 3-sentence} rationale for each rating. For analysis, we filter out participants that rate the negative control math problem (``What is 28 + 13?'') as having interestingness > 90, which filtered out the 6 outlier participants' responses.

   163: % For our Prolific study, we curate problems from AMC8 and AMC12, high school-level contests given by the Mathematical Association of America \cite{maa-amc}. To systematically probe how dimensions of a problem impact its perception and to increase problem set diversity, we introduce the notion of a \emph{variant}: a type of change that can be applied to a problem to transform it. Examples of variants include increasing/decreasing the sizes of the numbers in the problem, adding/removing steps, etc. For each contest problem, we hand-write a new problem based on a variant type. We also create two control problems: a negative and a positive control, which are later used to filter out any unfaithful participant ratings. This results in our final dataset for the Prolific study, which contains $18$ problems ($2$ controls and $8$ problems with one variant each). A list of all our problems and variants is provided in Appendix \ref{app:prolific}. 
   164: 
>  165: \paragraph{IMO data collection.} We conducted a survey of interestingness judgements made by participants at the 2024 IMO. Each of the 48 survey participants saw 4 problems. Each participant saw the same baseline: problem 1 from IMO 2024. The rest of the problems were selected randomly from IMO shortlists, with each participant survey being unique and including problems from the same area (Algebra, Combinatorics, Number Theory, and Geometry). The participants were asked if they wanted to see the solution to the problem before rating its \emph{interestingness} and \emph{difficulty}. They were also asked to select reasons for their interestingness and uninterestingness rating from a multiple choice list (see Appendix~\ref{app:imo-reasons}), plus an additional free-text box to state their own reasons. Most problems only received 1 to 2 responses; this is too few to compare human and model judgments at a per-problem level. As such, for the bulk of this paper, all IMO data comparisons are made over the interestingness \textit{criteria} that participants selected.

>  183: \paragraph{On average, LLM judgments of interestingness and difficulty are correlated with human judgments.} For each LLM, we compute the $R^2$ between per-problem mean interestingness in humans and the model (see Figure~\ref{fig:prolific-heatmaps-t1.0}).%  Each cell shows the squared correlation between the row and column agents’ mean ratings; the diagonal is $100$ by definition. 
   184: The human row/column reveal model–human agreement, while other row/column combinations report correlations amongst the models. On the Prolific dataset, model–human $R^2$ ranges from about 0.48 to 0.78, with the strongest agreements from the Mistral family. Split-half human $R^2$—our noise ceiling on explainable variance—is 0.71 (see Appendix~\ref{app:human_noise_ceiling}).  This indicates that current LLMs (especially those in the Mistral family) are able to approximate human perceptions of interestingness with surprising fidelity.

These variations stem from the absence of standardized conventions for embedding math in HTML, as well as the diversity of rendering engines (e.g., MathJax, KaTeX, MathML, image-based representations, and custom plugins). Moreover, websites frequently evolve their rendering strategies, making any fixed set of heuristics fragile in practice. As a result, existing extraction pipelines often fail to reliably extract scientific content, with equations either missed entirely, mis-parsed, or distorted. Preserving formatting is equally important: the indentation and layout of code blocks and the placement of mathematical symbols often carry semantic meaning, and losing this structure severely degrades the value of the extracted content for downstream modeling.

   464: We employ the following prompt to classify documents into a predefined set of categories. During classification, the large language model (LLM) occasionally produces category labels that fall outside the predefined taxonomy: Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics, Statistics, Economics, Chemistry,  and Other. To maintain consistency and reduce label fragmentation, any out-of-taxonomy label is reassigned to the category Other, ensuring a coherent and structured category distribution.

We used a sequence length of 8192 and global batch size of 768 (6291456 tokens per batch). we used a peak learning rate of $6\times10^{-4}$, and warmup over 8.3 billion toknes; we used cosine learning rate decay with a minimum value equal to 1\% of the peak value, and weight decay of 0.1. We use AdamW optimizer~\citep{loshchilov2017decoupled} with parameters $\beta_1=0.9$ and $\beta_2= 0.95$, and a gradient clipping threshold of 1.0.

  1857: To evaluate the value of our data, we setup a pretraining experiment. We used the same mixture as used in \citet{nvidia2025nemotronhfamilyaccurateefficient}. The data mixture spans eight broad content categories: web crawl, mathematics, Wikipedia, code, academic publications, high quality crawl subset (Crawl++), multilingual corpora, and synthetic instruction-style datasets. The Crawl++ category aggregates curated web-derived sources such as OpenWebText, BigScience, and Reddit. The multilingual component covers nine languages: Spanish, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Russian. To construct the mixtures, \citet{nvidia2025nemotronhfamilyaccurateefficient} applied uniform weighting within datasets of the same quality tier, and they assigned greater weight to datasets of higher quality.

Notably, these samples achieve unexpectedly high scores on both mathematical and language scores, raising concerns about the dataset’s overall reliability for pretraining LLMs. For each example, we provide the associated metadata. The excerpts shown correspond to the initial portion of each generation; in every case, the text extends over several additional pages, repeating the final sentence displayed.

   498: We observe that our pipeline not only keep the math equations but also keep the codes and their formatting.
   499: We observe that previous pipeline in most cases are not keeping codes or lose their formatting. This is specifically important for languages like python. To highlight this difference, we provide two sets of examples demonstrating both code and mathematical equations. Notably, inline equations are often removed in prior work, such as MegaMath.
