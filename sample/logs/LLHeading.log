   300: Diagnostic data is generated by various \textit{Electronic Control Units} (ECU) in a vehicle at irregular intervals. Diagnostic data differs substantially from raw sensor data, since diagnostic data or fault events are categorical and relate to various problems within the vehicle. We construct a \textit{Diagnosis Trouble Code} (DTC) indicating the precise error from 3 pieces of information arriving at the same timestamp $ts$ and mileage $d$: (1) the ID number of the ECU, (2) an error code (\textit{Base-DTC}) and (3) a \textit{Fault-Byte}. A single DTC token is composed of these 3 elements:
   301: $$ DTC = ECU|\textit{Base-DTC}|\textit{Fault-Byte} $$

   516: The problem asks for the number of subsets $S$ of the set $G = \{ k \mid 1 \leq k \leq 8, \gcd(k, 9) = 1 \}$ that satisfy two conditions: the sum of elements is divisible by 9, and the product of elements is congruent to 1 modulo 9.

   519: 
   520: First, we identify the elements of the set $G$ and analyze its structure as a cyclic group under multiplication modulo 9. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
