  1303:   We won't make too many assumptions about the service time for a job because that would interfere with our analysis from FCFS where we left it as an expression.
  1304: 
> 1305:   \item As for a comparison with FCFS in the average case, it usually does better assuming that we have a smooth probability distribution -- i.e. the probability of getting any particular priority is zero.
  1306:   In all of our formulas, we still have some probability mass to put on lower priority processes, bringing the expectation down.
  1307:   This statement doesn't hold for all smooth distributions but for most real-world smoothed distributions (which tend to be smooth) they do.

   145: Though deadlock is avoided, if the philosopher picks up the same device again and again in the same pattern, no work will be done.
   146: Livelock is generally harder to detect because the processes generally look like they are working to the outside operating system whereas in deadlock the operating system generally knows when two processes are waiting on a system-wide resource.
>  147: Another problem is that there are necessary conditions for livelock (i.e. deadlock fails to occur) but not sufficient conditions -- meaning there is no set of rules where livelock has to occur.
   148: You must formally prove in a system by what is known as an invariant.
   149: One has to enumerate each of the steps of a system and if each of the steps eventually -- after some finite number of steps -- leads to forward progress, the system fails to livelock.

This means that Brian is more likely to need many attempts before he gets $k=4$ successes. To put this another way, the probability of $n$ being small is low.

Each suit has its 13 cards labeled: \resp{2}, \resp{3}, ..., \resp{10}, \resp{J} (jack), \resp{Q} (queen), \resp{K} (king), and \resp{A} (ace). Thus, each card is a unique combination of a suit and a label, e.g. {\color{redcards}\resp{4$\heartsuit$}} and \resp{J$\clubsuit$}. The 12 cards represented by the jacks, queens, and kings are called \termsub{\resp{face cards}}{face card}.

Moreover, it is not difficult to verify that $\Phi$ is exactly the outer measure used for the Carat\'{e}odory's construction of a measure  if  $\phi_m$'s satisfy  Kolmogorov's consistency condition (see Proposition \ref{kce}). In the following, it will be shown, in particular, that our generalization of Carat\'{e}odory's outer measure is a way for obtaining measures on product spaces from measures on subspaces which do not satisfy Kolmogorov's consistency condition, but are consecutive images of each other under the shift map.

Taking into the account the wide spectrum of applications of them in the modern science (e.g. \cite{BDX},\cite{Barnsley},\cite{BHMS},\cite{FHK},\cite{Sl},\cite{BLLC}) leaves no doubts that the questions on stability of them are no less important than curious. It was shown in \cite{Wer6} that the energy functions associated with such systems are not even upper semicontinuous in general (even in the case of the usual regularity conditions on the probability functions). Nevertheless, the existence of equilibrium states for them has been proved \cite{Wer6}. However, the task of the construction of equilibrium states for such energy functions from non-invariant initial measures remained open. All author's attempts to use the well know technics of Gibbs measures failed. Here we obtain them using the construction of $\Phi$ even under conditions which are much weaker than those assumed in \cite{Wer6}. The definition of $\Phi$ resembles some of the constructions of Gibbs measures \cite{S} and connects it with the general way in which measures are constructed in the Measure Theory \cite{B}. Moreover, it is not difficult to see that the definition of $\Phi$ can be easily extended to more general dynamical systems. 
   149: 
   150: Every theory is based just on a few examples. In almost every text book, Gibbs measures are illustrated with the help of finite Markov chains, which are just  trivial cases of contractive Markov systems. If an example does not fit into the theory, the latter needs to be modified. Every working  example is guiding in this situation and therefore should not be ignored.

>  609:    It has been shown in \cite{HS} that there exists an invariant initial Borel probability distribution $\mu$ for a contractive Markov system on a Polish space if $(K_i)_{i=1}^N$ form an open partition of $K$. The condition of equivalence of measures $P^0_x$ and $P^0_y$ for all $x, y\in K_i$, $i=1,...,N$, is satisfied e.g. if probability functions $p_e|_{K_{i(e)}}$, $e\in E$, of a contractive Markov system have a {\it square summable variation} and are bounded away from zero \cite{Wer7}. By Proposition \ref{omrds} (ii), $\Phi(\nu_0)(\Sigma)>0$ for such systems. As far as the author is aware, the first result on the equivalence of measures $P^0_x$ and $P^0_y$ was obtained by J. H. Elton in \cite{E}, in the case when the partition has the single atom and the probability functions have a {\it summable variation} (Dini continuous) and are bounded away from zero.

>   45: A small experiment \cite{Pres-vs-Content-2014} found that presentation-based search engines provided better results than did meaning-based engines for the following types of equations: elementary functions (such as logarithm), and equations which have only one way of being written (excluding, for example, certain trigonometric expressions).  Special functions which have a standardized representation, such as the Legendre-Q function, were suggested to be equally well-matched by presentation-based and meaning-based search engines.  Equations which have multiple written forms were found to be better-matched by meaning-based search engines; examples include trigonometric expressions and certain special functions (e.g. Hermite-H, Poly-Gamma).

>  108: Translating from MathML to LaTeX can be useful, for example when copying special functions from the Wolfram Functions website.  However, given the limited options available for this, it might be easier to copy the relevant equations' pictures and upload them to a software which translates them into LaTeX.  Although many LaTeX to MathML translators exist online (e.g. MathMLCentral \cite{mathmlcentral}, MathToWeb \cite{mathtoweb}, LaTeX2MathML \cite{latex2mathml}, TeXZilla \cite{texzilla}), no operational web-hosted services for MathML to LaTeX could be found (one example of an inoperative one is “MathML to TeX online Translator “ \cite{orccaMathMLtoLatex}).  There are a couple of desktop solutions, although there seems to be no working desktop software.  One solution is to use the github-hosted program web-XSLT \cite{webxslt}: there are no usage instructions included, but the developer specified on a forum that it should be used with Saxon (or a different xslt2 engine) and run via the command ``java -jar saxon9.jar myfile.xml pmml2tex.xsl'' \cite{webxsltStEx}.  Alternatively, the XSLT MathML Library can be used with Saxon, via ``saxon -o output.tex input.mml xsltml\_2.1.2/mmltex.xsl''. \cite{xsltMathMLlibraryForTex}

    22: \subsection{Solve Math Problems}
>   23: Many times in physics, we encounter equations which impede progress.  The researchers who work on them can not find the solutions to them.  These equations might have solutions (e.g. approximations, work-arounds, or more useful - mathematically equivalent - ways of expressing them) which are known to certain fields of math, or which have been used elsewhere in physics or the other sciences.  Yet, finding them has so far been prevented by the use of jargon and the inefficiency of identifying collaborators who know something about the solution.  Math-aware search engines help a researcher to identify systems, fields, and collaborators which would enable the system of interest to be better understood and/or applied.  Good examples of this inter-disciplinary approach benefiting physics include the AdS/CFT correspondence and holographic duality theories.  To expand upon this point, it has been said (in math) that ``we don't even know how much we know that we don't know we know'' \cite{Hazewinkel-MKM-is-needed}: finding what is applicable out of what we know is a good approach to make progress.
    24: 
    25: The development of emergent theories, fundamental physics, effective theories, applied physics, experiments, and phenomenology can all benefit from such improvements.

    27: \subsection{Design Models and Match them with Physical Systems}
>   28: Finding mathematical models which are useful for a case can be done by first coming up with a model which is reasonable but hard to solve, then researching ways to make it more tractable.  The first model which one comes up with need not, then, be the best model: searching the literature can locate refinements which make it more solvable.  This might include avoiding the equation in question by changing the modeling setup, rewriting the equation into an equivalent but manageable format, or making approximations which other researchers have found to work well.  Context will need to be considered, of course, but having this start at discovering better models is priceless.  Keyword-based search engines can help with this, but they are inherently limited by varying terminologies between fields (i.e. jargon) and the need to know what kind of systems one wants to find.  These equation-based search engines enable researchers to find mathematical models using the most appropriate language: that of math.  They already know some of the ``synonyms'' of math (such as $a+b = b+a$), and will only improve with time.

    40: If a researcher can identify that a function of interest is a special function, then new resources become available with which to solve it.
    41: 
>   42: However, this application is not well-developed yet.  Although databases of special functions exist, their math-aware search engines do not recognize all possible ways of writing special functions.  For instance, the definitions of the special function ``Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind'' are different on each of Wolfram Alpha, DLMF, and Wolfram Functions (from which the ``primary definition'' was taken); none of the special function databases' search engines (i.e. Wolfram Alpha and DLMF) recognize the definitions which came from one of the other three websites.  Yet, it can work to identify special functions via this route, given present capabilities: both Wolfram Alpha and the DLMF recognized the complementary error function's ($\erfc(x)$) definitions which were drawn from the same three websites.  These experiments with special functions are described in slightly more detail in section \ref{sec:math-meaning-limitations}.
    43: 
    44: For now, using a search engine of this type to identify special functions is limited: it can provide a positive identification, but can not tell a researcher that a given function is \emph{not} a special function.  As math-aware search engines get better at translating between different math notations, this application will be more complete.

    57: \subsection{Look up the meaning of unfamiliar math notation}
>   58: Especially when doing interdisciplinary research, it is easy for a researcher to come across notation which he or she is unfamiliar with.  The context is not always explained adequately, in the text, for that researcher to easily find the notation's meaning: field's conventions and ``common knowledge'' are often not stated in publications. \cite{DavenportEtAl2003, Rec-and-retrieval-rev}  Math-aware search engines which use equations' structure (i.e. ``Presentation-based'') to search for results can be used to find more information about the unfamiliar notation.  For example, the search engine ``Tangent'' proposes this application as a use of its software for both students and researchers \cite{Tangent-thesis}; for students, they give the example that the binomial coefficient's notation ($^4_2$) could be drawn in $m_{in}$ (section \ref{sec:min-description}) and subsequently searched for \cite{Tangent-pub-2015,Wangari-et-al_2014_paper}.  For researchers, an application might be to look up why $\pi(2) = 1$, which applies when discussing the ``prime counting function''. \cite{Wangari-et-al_2014_paper}

    86: However, this application is only possible when the mathematical meaning of formulas can be recognized by math-aware search engines, to an extent which lets them match equivalent formulas which are written in different ways.  Their present level of meaning-extraction is probably far too low to enable this use, although their in-development upgrade to parse meaning using \emph{Mathematica}-type software will likely make this feasible. 
    87: 
>   88: Improvements to this application are possible with certain feature developments in the math-aware search engine.  For instance, if the results could be \emph{ranked according to solvability} - that is, whether an equation can and/or has been solved analytically (or numerically, in an efficient manner) - then researchers could find ways of writing their equation such that solutions fall out easily.  This goes beyond \emph{Mathematica}, since even \emph{Mathematica} (and similar software) sometimes needs equations to be written in different representations in order to solve them.  Furthermore, \emph{Mathematica} can not change how the mathematical model is attached to the physical world (e.g. is $x$ the linear distance from a point, or the distance along a curved wire?), which a researcher who views equation results could do.  When a researcher searches existing models, the searcher can also see what assumptions were useful to those models, and decide whether they can apply to the system at hand; \emph{Mathematica} requires many such assumptions to be included as input to the equation.  Finding information in the literature can therefore be of benefit beyond what \emph{Mathematica}-like systems provide, for solving equations.  If these search engines could determine whether a given equation format is solvable, or read that data from the document which includes it, then finding solvable mathematical models (or just equations) in the literature becomes easier.

The over 1.1 million arXiv.org pre-prints are also stated to be serviceable by MathWebSearch, provided that server space is provided for the search engine. \cite{MathWebSearch-info}  The developers of these search engines want to provide math-aware search over additional scientific resources (e.g. \cite{MathWebSearch-info, Kohlhase-Scaling-MWS, RakosnikEtAl2014, WebMIaS-descr-pub-2014}), including servicing databases on the order of current keyword-based search engines' sizes \cite{Tangent-pub-2015}.

    60: These search engines take a queried equation, and find equivalent and similar equations to it.  The main algorithms used, in this task, are presentation-based search and meaning-based search.  The applied uses of each are overviewed in section \ref{sec:pres-vs-meaning-usage}.  Within these two categories, the abilities of the available math-aware search engines vary considerably.
    61: 
>   62: In general, most of the meaning-based search engines can understand commutativity ($a+b=b+a$), allow variables' names and constants' values to change, and allow variations in the equations' structure (i.e. adding or dropping terms, allowing entire expressions to take the place of a variable, etc.).  The grand majority of them can not do associativity ($ab = ba$) or distributivity ($a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$), except by allowing variables' names to vary and terms to be re-arranged.  More complex math equivalencies are generally not included; however, progress is being made to incorporate \emph{Mathematica}-like Computer Algebra Systems into the engines' algorithms, so that all the mathematical rules, simplifications, and other tools of \emph{Mathematica} can be used in identifying which equations are equivalent, mathematically. \cite{Oviedo-Th, Liska-PhD-Prop}
    63: 
    64: In this section, the abilities of each meaning-based and presentation-based search engine is reviewed.  The meaning-based engines' discussion focuses on the extent to which their algorithms are able to recognize mathematically equivalent expressions which differ visually.  In contrast, the presentation-based engines' discourse considers which criteria the engines define to say which equations are ``structurally similar''.

For example, it will add terms which it thinks appropriate: $\sin^2$ will be appended with and $(x)$ to make it $\sin^2(x)$. \cite{DLMF-2007}  If a query returns no exact matches, then the DLMF's engine allows the symbols in the equation to be re-arranged (thus approximating commutativity and associativity) and to be separated by other math terms; this is a form of ``query relaxation''. \cite{DLMF-AMS-notice, Liska-Th}

   134: Based on experimentation with the online version, equations which are considered ``similar'' to one another can have interchanged variables and constants, differently named variables, constants of differing values, and terms added or removed. \cite{TangentSE} For example, searching for ``g(z) = 0'' returns results which include the following: $g(z) = 0$, $g(E) = 0$, $g(0) = 0$, and $h(z) = 0$.  \cite{Tangent-pub-2015, TangentSE} The latter three of these results all share the same ``score'' - that is, they are considered to have the same degree of similarity to the input equation. \cite{TangentSE}
   135: 
>  136: The web-available demo version of Tangent is an old version of the software (v0.1).  Developers have now released version 0.3.1, which is available for download and use; that version was used for a recent competition in math-aware information retrieval. \cite{dprl-descriptions, ntcir12tangent}  Its upgrades include better discovery of ``similar'' equations, broader wildcard support (including allowing a single wildcard to represent a subexpression, instead of just one symbol), keywords alongside equations in a query, and scalability. \cite{ntcir12tangent, tangent2016sigir, Tangent-technical-v0.3, tangent2014ntcir}  It allows subexpressions to be subsitituted for other subexpressions, regardless of their mathematical meaning or size - for example, $\sin(a + b)$ has the subexpression $(a+b)$, which can be substituted for any other expression inside parenthesis when retrieving results. \cite{ntcir12tangent} Notationally, this updated engine can also query matrices, prefix subscripts (e.g. $_nC$), and prefix superscripts (e.g. $^rC$). \cite{tangent2014ntcir}  Possible upcoming features indicated by the developers include incorporating textual context into equation matching \cite{tangent2016sigir}, improving keyword-vs-equation weighting when ranking results \cite{ntcir12tangent}, and adjusting the weight which is given to matching variables (versus allowing them to vary) when retrieving and ranking results \cite{ntcir12tangent}.

   142: The developers of MIaS give a fair bit of detail about what their algorithms can do.  Their engine - currently used to search over journal articles - uses presentation-based search but is moving towards incorporating meaning-based algorithms. \cite{Liska-PhD-Prop}
   143: 
>  144: When finding similar equations, the engine allows constants' values and variables' names to change. \cite{Liska-PhD-Prop}  However, it distinguishes between variables with and without subscripts (e.g. $x_1$ vs $x$), and does not allow them to be interchanged.  For example, the query $x_1 + y_1$ would \emph{not} retrieve $x + y$.  \cite{Liska-PhD-Prop}  This treatment of subscripts can be problematic for physics applications, because subscripts are often used to denote which physical characteristics a variable is attached to (such as $x_i$ for the position at a certain time, or $d_s$ for the distance to Saturn); these subscripts have no mathematical significance, except to distinguish one variable from another.  Another equation characteristic which is allowed to vary is that subexpressions in the query are searched for: for example, the query $a + b^{c+2}$ has the subexpressions $b^{c+2}$ and $c+2$. \cite{Liska-PhD-Prop}  Furthermore, the structure of equations is recently able to be considered in matching formulae: $x + y/z$ would structurally match $a + \sqrt{b}/c$, having the form ``item1 + item2 / item3''.  Finally, the mathematical equivalency of commutativity is accounted for, so that $a + 5$ is considered equal to $5 + a$. \cite{Liska-PhD-Prop}  
   145: 
   146: Some problematic queries, for MIaS, are elucidated in \cite{Liska-Th}.  These were queries which were sent with knowledge of what should be retrieved, based on a human assessment, and which the algorithm failed at.  Some situations where the query did not succeed included: (a) a query used ``$=$'', whereas the target equation used ``$\equiv$'', (b) the query wrote text in math-mode using ``\textbackslash{}text\{\}'', whereas the target did so with ``\textbackslash{}rm\{\}'', (c) the target equation was broken up into multiple lines, whereas the input was on one line. \cite{Liska-Th}

    42: To assess models using exact match, we force the final boxed answers to follow consistent formatting rules.
>   43: Specifically, probabilities are expressed as simplified fractions. Moreover, matrix entry fractions are encoded with \verb|x/y|, while all other fractions are consistently encoded with the \verb|\frac{x}{y}| command. Coefficients are encoded without a multiplication symbol (e.g. \verb|5x| not \verb|5*x|). Expressions with multiple variables are entered in alphabetical order; polynomials are expressed in decreasing degree order. Different fraction encodings equivalent, such as \texttt{\textbackslash frac\{x\}\{y\}} and \texttt{\textbackslash dfrac\{x\}\{y\}} and \texttt{x/y}. Different parenthesis encodings, such as \texttt{\textbackslash left(} and \texttt{(}, are treated as equivalent.
    44: 
    45: We also allow units to be included or omitted from an answer, we ignore spaces, and we treat common equivalent ways of expressing the same number (e.g., $0.5$ and $1/2$, or $0.1$ and $.1$) as the same. When the answer is a factorized polynomial, we permit different orderings of the factors, so that $4(x+1)(x-1)$ is equivalent to $4(x-1)(x+1)$, and so on. These rules cover nearly all ways that different generated or actual solutions can be equivalent in practice.

   196: \subsubsection{Number Theory} So it is just appropriate to begin with an example about number theory, the field of research of Hardy, who was absolutely proud of doing research in a pure area of math, with no applications whatsoever.
   197: 
>  198: Hardy in his \textit{A mathematician's apology} \cite{H} makes quite a point of personal pride in number theory being a completely pure (and useless) branch of mathematics. And he was quite right! Number theory deals with the distribution and the properties of prime numbers and so it is a subject of great charm, ancient (the proof that there are infinite prime numbers and Eratosthenes' sieve date back to Ancient Greece) and full of elementary problems (e.g. Goldbach's conjecture), which are easy to state and extremely difficult to solve. This characteristic lead to a heap of amateurs trying to solve very difficult conjectures in this field across centuries\footnote{And this often lead to frustration professional number theorist who continue to recieve "proofs" from amateurs, see e.g the nice \textit{Dialogue on Prime Numbers} written by Zaccagnini \cite{Z}}. Few succeded, most didn't, and a lot of appearently simple conjectures are still unsolved.
   199: 
   200: So Number Theory always had a great appeal, both to professional mathematicians, amateurs and the wide audience. But no one ever questioned its being a totally pure and abstract area of mathematics, whose interest belonged all to the world of pure ideas and not to our material world.

Namely, number theory allows for a method in which the encryption key is public but the decryption key is private, thus allowing anyone to send messages to the receiver (e.g. your password to a website or the PIN of your credit card to your bank) without having to worry about a third party decrypting the message.
   234:

   414: I mean, I know that during the history of math all these different kinds of equations were solved (and given funny names), but math is not about zoology or funny names: math is about the struggle to find a path that lead to the solution of problems. Not necessarily the smartest and shortest path. Not immediately, anyhow.
   415: 
>  416: A possible different teaching sequence would be to start from problems: give the students some problems, which once mathematized turn out into solving a second degree polynomial. Some of the problems should be aesily solvable (i.e. lead to an equation of the form $x^2=d$ or $x^2+bx=0$), some should lead to a complete equation with no vanishing terms. The students will find by themselves how to solve the simpler ones, and maybe will even give a try to the more difficult ones. Guided by the teacher, working in groups, they may rediscover themselves the formula (maybe by completing the square) and teach it to other groups. A discover made by themselves, while trying to solve a problem and effectively experiencing the hardness of the problem and the sense of joy that comes with the solution, will leave the students something more than just a formula to blindly apply. Most of all, it will leave them with the sense of doing math.
   417: 
   418: And after the group work, a good recap by the teacher would be nice, so to put all the ideas (which came from the students) in order. Doing like that, probably a lot more of them will remember the formula, but most important will know how to find it again if needed.

>    4: Explorable explanations~\cite{victor2011explorable} have emerged as an increasingly popular practice to teach and learn abstract concepts across various educational contexts, such as math, science, and engineering (e.g. \textit{PhET}~\cite{perkins2006phet}, \textit{Distill}~\cite{distill}). Interactive explanations that leverage animations, simulations, and gaming provide more engaging experiences, naturally encouraging students to develop their understanding of complex concepts in a playful manner~\cite{adams2010student, hensberry2015effective, keller2007assessing, wang2020cnn}. Many of these math augmentation techniques were demonstrated in Bret Victor's KillMath projects~\cite{victor2011killmath}.
     5: Various tools, such as \textit{Idyll}~\cite{conlen2018idyll}, \textit{Flapjax}~\cite{meyerovich2009flapjax}, \textit{GeoGebra}~\cite{GeoGebra95:online}, \textit{Mavo}~\cite{verou2016mavo}, and \textit{Data Theater}~\cite{lau2020data}, have been similarly developed to lower the barrier to create interactive explanations. For example, \textit{Idyll Studio}~\cite{conlen2021idyll} allows users to create data-driven explanations and \textit{GeoGebra}~\cite{GeoGebra95:online} lets users make interactive diagrams to teach various math topics such as geometry, algebra, and calculus.

>   18: Since Wellner's first demonstration of \textit{DigitalDesk}~\cite{wellner1991digitaldesk}, HCI researchers have actively explored the idea of \textit{augmented paper} by overlaying digital content onto physical documents~\cite{Han2021hybrid}. Researchers have investigated various ways to augment physical paper, including projecting digital information (e.g., \textit{AffinityLens}~\cite{subramonyam2019affinity}, \textit{MouseLight}~\cite{Song2010mouseLight}, \textit{Qook}~\cite{zhao2014qook}), illuminate physical paper (e.g., \textit{IllumiPaper}~\cite{klamka2017illumipaper}), and embedding content in mobile AR (e.g., \textit{Opportunistic Interfaces}~\cite{du2022opportunistic}, \textit{Teachable Reality}~\cite{monteiro2023teachable}) or see-through displays (e.g. \textit{MagicBook}~\cite{billinghurst2001magicbook}, \textit{Mixed Reality Book}~\cite{Grasset2007mixed}, \textit{HoloDoc}~\cite{Li2019holodoc}, \textit{Replicate and Reuse}~\cite{gupta2020replicate}).
    19: However, most of these works assume prepared content, and only a few works have looked into the \textit{authoring aspect} of these augmented documents.
    20: For example, \textit{PapARVis Designer}~\cite{chen2020augmenting} allows users to author embedded visualizations for static paper, and

However, there is a lack of authoring tools that enables the users to augment existing visual content such as physical paper.
    36: Moreover, creating dynamic AR content typically requires user-defined demonstrations (e.g. \textit{Rapido}~\cite{Leiva2021rapido}, \textit{Pronto}~\cite{Leiva2020pronto}) or pre-defined animations (e.g. \textit{Reality Composer}~\cite{RealityComposer}, \textit{Adobe Aero}~\cite{aero}). While these approaches work for general-purpose AR prototyping, they are not well-suited for AR-based explorable explanations, where animation should be bound to mathematical formulas or simulations. 
    37: To address these limitations, our proposed authoring tool leverages machine learning and data-binding techniques. This allows users to extract existing content from documents to create interactive AR explanations tailored to their needs, facilitating the creation of engaging educational materials.

    51: \paragraph*{II. Braids.} In 2018, I (Wilson) asked Wolfson back into the rehearsal studio to help decipher patterns and structures in reconstructed Shaker (a Utopian millenarian American religious sect) dances that the company was incorporating into a new performance. One specific movement sequence was giving the dancers difficulty, and when we tried to track the movements based on the paths of individual dancers, we kept getting confused and tangled up.  Wolfson realized that if you tracked pairs of dancers, then each pair traced ``elementary braids’’ and the movement of all four dancers could be represented as a ``4-stranded braid.''   This was particularly striking because Shaker iconography and theology was heavily imbued with braiding, both as fiber art and as emblem of communal meanings. Wolfson explained his experience to the dancers as follows,
>   52: \begin{quote}
    53: Braids provide a key mathematical tool for describing how 2D and 3D spaces are put together.  They arise in multiple mathematical contexts, from motion of particles on a surface (e.g. molecules in a solution, robots on a factory floor, satellites orbiting the earth), to the solutions of families of polynomial equations. In my research, I am trying to show that certain equations don’t admit simple solutions because the associated braids are too complicated. Any time you find a new context where braids arise, you want to understand it.  I felt really excited to realize there were braids in Shaker dances, and pretty complicated ones at that. The braids were the defining structural element of the dance. Someone clearly had knowledge of braids here and they were using it in a context that for me was totally unexpected.  What else did they know?  Maybe there is knowledge there that you’ve missed, or structure you can use to understand another application.

    58: Thurston’s revolutionary work on 3-dimensional geometry was one of the major developments of 20th century mathematics. Thurston advocated approaching geometry from the basic question: What is it like to live in, really live in, the abstract spaces we are studying?  While Thurston’s call has driven fundamental advances over the last forty years, it has largely been interpreted as an unembodied perspective, e.g. the motion of point particles or simple bodies like tinker toys. Can choreographic knowledge push (advance) this further?

>  267: By leveraging an efficient pre-training task (e.g. token masking or next token prediction) and then fine-tuning a smaller model with fewer parameters for specific tasks, Transformer-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing tasks \cite{bert, gpt3}.
   268: For example, the GPT model is pre-trained on the next token prediction task, where the labels are generated by shifting the tokens to the right. Then, a classification head is added on top of the Transformer model to assign a probability to each token. Contrary to BERT \cite{bert} a causal mask is applied so that tokens can only attend to the previous one, thus preventing cheating. In section \ref{sec:pretraining} we will introduce a pre-trained model serving as an encoder trained on specific event prediction tasks to ensure adaptability to the event stream domain of vehicles. We found that modelling event streams with autoregressive Transformer-based models for fault predictions were not addressed well in the literature \cite{nppreview} although there is some related work for TPPs \cite{lin2022exploring, shou2024selfsupervisedcontrastivepretrainingmultivariate}.

>  552: By applying a \textit{cross} attention, we can see improvement in all metrics (\textit{rotnocross-ce-1-2}), which is consistent with the machine translation analogy \textit{"dtc2errorpattern"}. The best cross attention results were shown with $H(S)$ used as \textit{key-value}. Adding the mileage via an MLP layer (\textit{cross-mixffn}) seemed to help the MAPE (-2.5\%), the $\text{CPMWAUC}_{\text{f1}}(+9)$ and also the $\text{CPMWAUC}_\text{mae}(-0.005)$ compared to \textit{time-cross-query} model, suggesting that mileage is beneficial for both task. This makes sense since EPs are also dependent on the traveled distances between DTCs and the different stationary behavior of the vehicle.

Adding $\mathbf{CE}$ to the last layer (\textit{ce-2}) gave the best results, as opposed to adding it to both layers (\textit{ce-1-2}).

We monitored the need for our \textit{Random Event Head} in Figure \ref{fig:randomhead} (Appendix \ref{appendix:cpmwauc}) and noticed $+1.2\%$ in the F1 Score and $+10.1$ in the $\text{CPMW}_{f1}$.

   551: Our experiments revealed several key insights:
   552: By applying a \textit{cross} attention, we can see improvement in all metrics (\textit{rotnocross-ce-1-2}), which is consistent with the machine translation analogy \textit{"dtc2errorpattern"}. The best cross attention results were shown with $H(S)$ used as \textit{key-value}. Adding the mileage via an MLP layer (\textit{cross-mixffn}) seemed to help the MAPE (-2.5\%), the $\text{CPMWAUC}_{\text{f1}}(+9)$ and also the $\text{CPMWAUC}_\text{mae}(-0.005)$ compared to \textit{time-cross-query} model, suggesting that mileage is beneficial for both task. This makes sense since EPs are also dependent on the traveled distances between DTCs and the different stationary behavior of the vehicle. Furthermore, models incorporating a RoPE (\textit{rot}) performed significantly better in both regression and classification tasks like in the pre-training, highlighting the performance of RoPE in machine translation tasks \cite{Roformer}.

    64: 2019 C4 & On a flat plane in Camelot, King Arthur builds a labyrinth \$\textbackslash{}mathfrak\{L\}\$ consisting of \$n\$ walls, each of which is an infinite straight line. No two walls are parallel, and no three walls have a common point. Merlin then paints one side of each wall entirely red and the other side entirely blue.   At the intersection of two walls there are four corners: two diagonally opposite corners where a red side and a blue side meet, one corner where two red sides meet, and one corner where two blue sides meet. At each such intersection, there is a two-way door connecting the two diagonally opposite corners at which sides of different colours meet.   After Merlin paints the walls, Morgana then places some knights in the labyrinth. The knights can walk through doors, but cannot walk through walls.   Let \$k(\textbackslash{}mathfrak\{L\})\$ be the largest number \$k\$ such that, no matter how Merlin paints the labyrinth \$\textbackslash{}mathfrak\{L\}\$, Morgana can always place at least \$k\$ knights such that no two of them can ever meet. For each \$n\$, what are all possible values for \$k(\textbackslash{}mathfrak\{L\})\$, where \$\textbackslash{}mathfrak\{L\}\$ is a labyrinth with \$n\$ walls? \\
    65: 2019 C5 & On a certain social network, there are 2019 users, some pairs of which are friends, where friendship is a symmetric relation. Initially, there are 1010 people with 1009 friends each and 1009 people with 1010 friends each. However, the friendships are rather unstable, so events of the following kind may happen repeatedly, one at a time:   Let \$A, B\$, and \$C\$ be people such that \$A\$ is friends with both \$B\$ and \$C\$, but \$B\$ and \$C\$ are not friends; then \$B\$ and \$C\$ become friends, but \$A\$ is no longer friends with them.   Prove that, regardless of the initial friendships, there exists a sequence of such events after which each user is friends with at most one other user. \\

The points are to be labelled \$A\_\{1\}, A\_\{2\}, \textbackslash{}ldots, A\_\{2n\}\$ in some order. We then consider the \$2n\$ angles \$\textbackslash{}angle A\_\{1\} A\_\{2\} A\_\{3\}\$, \$ \textbackslash{}angle A\_\{2\} A\_\{3\} A\_\{4\}, \textbackslash{}ldots, \textbackslash{}angle A\_\{2n-2\} A\_\{2n-1\} A\_\{2n\}, \textbackslash{}angle A\_\{2n-1\} A\_\{2n\} A\_\{1\}, \textbackslash{}angle A\_\{2n\} A\_\{1\} A\_\{2\}\$. We measure each angle in the way that gives the smallest positive value (i.e. between \$0\textasciicircum{}\{\textbackslash{}circ\}\$ and \$180\textasciicircum{}\{\textbackslash{}circ\}\$). Prove that there exists an ordering of the given points such that the resulting \$2n\$ angles can be separated into two groups with the sum of one group of angles equal to the sum of the other group. \\
    67: 2019 C7 & There are 60 empty boxes \$B\_\{1\}, \textbackslash{}ldots, B\_\{60\}\$ in a row on a table and an unlimited supply of pebbles. Given a positive integer \$n\$, Alice and Bob play the following game.   In the first round, Alice takes \$n\$ pebbles and distributes them into the 60 boxes as she wishes. Each subsequent round consists of two steps:  \textbackslash{}begin\{enumerate\}  \textbackslash{}item[(a)] Bob chooses an integer \$k\$ with \$1 \textbackslash{}leqslant k \textbackslash{}leqslant 59\$ and splits the boxes into the two groups \$B\_\{1\}, \textbackslash{}ldots, B\_\{k\}\$ and \$B\_\{k+1\}, \textbackslash{}ldots, B\_\{60\}\$.  \textbackslash{}item[(b)] Alice picks one of these two groups, adds one pebble to each box in that group, and removes one pebble from each box in the other group.  \textbackslash{}end\{enumerate\}  Bob wins if, at the end of any round, some box contains no pebbles. Find the smallest \$n\$ such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning. \\
    68: 2019 C8 & Alice has a map of Wonderland, a country consisting of \$n \textbackslash{}geqslant 2\$ towns. For every pair of towns, there is a narrow road going from one town to the other. One day, all the roads are declared to be "one way" only. Alice has no information on the direction of the roads, but the King of Hearts has offered to help her. She is allowed to ask him a number of questions. For each question in turn, Alice chooses a pair of towns and the King of Hearts tells her the direction of the road connecting those two towns.   Alice wants to know whether there is at least one town in Wonderland with at most one outgoing road. Prove that she can always find out by asking at most \$4n\$ questions. \\
