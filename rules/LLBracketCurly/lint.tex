	\begin{tabular}{lll}
		\verb|\max(a,b)|  & $\max(a,b)$  & \tA{ok}  \\
		\verb|\max{a,b}|  & $\max{a,b}$  & \tD{ng}  \\

We cannot fully determine whether the use of curly brackets is wrong or not.
It is not detected if some spaces are inserted between the command name and the curly brackets.

$\min(a,b)$ and $\min{a,b}$ are also checked.
