# How to Publish

## hack

Make your changes.

In most of cases, you only need to edit files in the `rules` and `src` folders.

Never edit the following folders: images, other, out, sample, README.md and package.json. These files are auto-generated or not related to rules.ã€€If necessary, please edit the template files in the `script/basis` folder.

If you are doing a bug fix, add test cases to `rules/LLRuleName/lint.tex` as a comment and update `rules/LLRuleName/README.md` and `rules/LLRuleName/values.json` if necessary.

## prepare

run `uv run script/main.py`.
This command will auto-generate some ts files, README.md and package.json.

If any error occurs, fix it first.

## compile

F5 to compile.

If you are an AI, please skip this step.

## write changelog

Write your changes in CHANGELOG.md

If you are an AI, please end your response here.

## publish

You can auto-increment its version number by specifying the SemVer-compatible number or version (major, minor, or patch) to increment.

```bash
vsce publish patch|minor|major
```
