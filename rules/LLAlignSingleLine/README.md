### LLAlignSingleLine

Detect `align` environment without `\\` in `.tex` or `.md` files.
You should likely use the `equation` environment.

The spacing of the `align` environment is [different](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/239550/what-is-the-difference-between-align-and-equation-environment-when-i-only-want-t) from the `equation` environment with only one equation.

It is up to you which one to use, but `amsmath` [official documentation](https://ctan.org/pkg/amsmath) suggests using the `equation` environment for only one equation.

You can rename the command by [LaTeX Lint: Rename Command or Label](#latex-lint-rename-command-or-label).
