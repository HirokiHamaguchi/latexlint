>  143: The corpus consists of an unknown number of online tutors (a tutor could be represented in more than one dialogue) who were college students at a Pennsylvanian university. The students were middle school students, ranging from 6th-8th grade, from two schools. The student-level demographics represented in the corpus are unknown, however, the school-level demographics consisted of 52\% Latinx from a California public school and 100\% Black and male from a Pennsylvania charter school. Math proficiency is low at both schools, with  one school at zero percent proficiency suggesting the majority of students have low self-efficacy in learning math. Tutoring was performed remotely using Pencil as a remote communication platform with audio recordings transcribed within the platform. Individual dialogue recordings ranged in size from 100 bytes to 37KB. Transcriptions between 2KB and 8KB were used to provide sufficient utterances to assess dialogue while not overloading and slowing down the processing of  the GPT models. In addition, we strive to keep costs low, particularly when scaling to more transcriptions. For all transcriptions, the tutor was the first utterance in the dialogue, which was used as a guide in diarization. We prompt GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 using the prompt created (shown in Appendix E), with the temperature at 0. Running the prompt on 50 real-life tutoring dialogues, we  report the absolute performance of each model compared to a human grader. Appendix E displays the prompt used to assess real-life dialogues.

The responses are graded using a GPT-4 grader, where GPT-4 Omni checks the correctness of a solution response against the ground truth solution. This allows us to account for cases where incorrect reasoning traces lead to a correct final answer. Appendix~\ref{app:prompt_eval} shows the prompt used for evaluation. During response generation, we set the temperature to 0 and top\_p to 1 for all models.

>   20: \noindent\textbf{Overview}. To this end, we explore using two 7B SLMs (a policy SLM and a PRM) to generate higher-quality training data, with their smaller size allowing for extensive MCTS rollouts on accessible hardware (e.g., 4$\times$40GB A100 GPUs). However, self-generating data presents greater challenges for SLMs, due to their weaker capabilities.
    21: SLMs frequently fail to generate correct solutions, and even when the final answer is correct, the intermediate steps are often flawed or of poor quality. Moreover, SLMs solve fewer challenging problems compared to advanced models like GPT-4.

   141: \section{The Collection of \dataset} \vspace{-0.5em}
>  142: We construct the \dataset corpus from Common Crawl\footnote{\url{https://commoncrawl.org/}}, a large-scale web archive extensively used in recent LLM training \citep{dubey2024llama, hui2024qwen25codertechnicalreport, deepseekai2025deepseekv3technicalreport}. Common Crawl contains over 300B documents across more than 6M WARC files (each contains over 1GB of compressed content). Our goal is to build a pipeline that can process the technical content from Common Crawl correctly. We apply our pipeline to math domain to assemble a high-quality, large-scale corpus of mathematical content from Common Crawl. To achieve this, we designed a robust and highly scalable data processing pipeline capable of operating at the full scale of Common Crawl, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}.
