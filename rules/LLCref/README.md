Detect `\ref` in `.tex` files.
You should likely use `\cref` or `\Cref` in the [cleveref](https://ctan.org/pkg/cleveref) package instead.
This rule is disabled by default.

We prefer this package because it can automatically add prefixes like "Sec." or "Fig.". We can keep the consistency of the reference format.
