>  193: \section{The visitors' impressions} \label{sec4} Multimedia installations and interwoven threads were not the only factors of success for the first set-up of the exhibition \textit{MadeInMath}. The animators were of crucial importance because they were mediators between organizers and visitors. Master students in various degrees in science (Mathematics, Biology, Physics, etc.) have been trained on the topics covered by the exhibition to accompany the many school-groups, but also to follow individual visitors, or small groups of hesitant visitors. For animators it was undoubtedly a formative moment for their training and their personal growth. Each of them, in fact, was free to propose their reading of the contents of the exhibition because the exhibition has various interpretations and visits had different cuts. People reported that they visited it twice and had different impressions each time. The ability to create connections between seemingly unrelated issues is one of the most powerful activity of mathematics, which gave the show an edge. It was thanks to all these facets that each visitor could grasp interesting aspects depending on their age, their training and their own interests. As commented in \cite{tg} by one of the animators, Maurizio Giaffredo, each of us animators took away a wealth of meetings and reflections whose value derives from the diversity of people and ideas that we had the chance to meet. In just two weeks the exhibition was visited by over 40,000 visitors. Of these, about 18,000 were students, mostly from middle and  high school. This means that more than half of the visitors fall into the category `general public`, which was quite a success. Beyond the figures, it was impressive to experience a high level of satisfaction by visitors. An initial indicator in this regard was to see students on a visit with the class during the week and then see them again at the weekend with their parents or other friends to illustrate some of the content of the exhibition as if they were young guides. A second indicator comes from the evidence left by visitors. Let us quote some of the thousands that people delighted in leaving. One of them says: "We knew the beauty of mathematics, but we did not suspect that  it was so beautiful. Thank you also for the love and attention to the teacher's figure". In fact, part of the exhibition gave space to the admirable work done every day by teachers, in this case those of mathematics. We were particularly pleased that this aspect has been apprehended and appreciated. Further evidence comes from some foreign visitors, who wrote: "I wish I had paid more attention to math class!" indicating the fact that the exhibition has managed to somehow overcome the misconception regarding mathematics and bring in the foreground some of the fundamental aspects of the teaching of mathematics (but not only), such as curiosity, wonder and the transmission of important ideas and not only tedious techniques. In this regard, a visitor wrote that he/she discovered a new world. In this sense, the initial disorientation was overcome in an unexpected and positive way because the exhibition succeeded in unveiling the potential of mathematics, which previously seemed unattainable. Another witness is grateful for the many ideas and so many hints that would be used at school for events on the subject of mathematics. There have also been some criticism, sometimes because of the difficulty in understanding certain topics. For this, as we discussed before, the guides were really fundamental because they played a role as a cultural mediator. The comments regarding some guides have been very positive, as, for example, "The exhibition is very beautiful but the enthusiasm of our guide was exceptional". Finally, we would like to quote a comment by a visitor, probably very young, that after the visit wrote that the exhibition was better than \textit {Gardaland} (an amusement park)!

Special functions which have a standardized representation, such as the Legendre-Q function, were suggested to be equally well-matched by presentation-based and meaning-based search engines.  Equations which have multiple written forms were found to be better-matched by meaning-based search engines; examples include trigonometric expressions and certain special functions (e.g. Hermite-H, Poly-Gamma).

    63: Some search engines allow the user to search for multiple equations at once. \cite{SojkaEtAl2011, Tangent-article-2015, Tangent-pub-2015, DLMF-website}  This allows initial conditions to be added to a search, among other things.  The searched equations do not have to occur in the same portion of the paper.  As with Google, these equation-based search engines may relax the query if the equations can not be found to occur in the same document: as does MIaS \cite{SojkaEtAl2011}, they might require only one or more of the multiple query equations to be found in the paper.

    26: 
>   27: \subsection{Design Models and Match them with Physical Systems}
    28: Finding mathematical models which are useful for a case can be done by first coming up with a model which is reasonable but hard to solve, then researching ways to make it more tractable.  The first model which one comes up with need not, then, be the best model: searching the literature can locate refinements which make it more solvable.  This might include avoiding the equation in question by changing the modeling setup, rewriting the equation into an equivalent but manageable format, or making approximations which other researchers have found to work well.  Context will need to be considered, of course, but having this start at discovering better models is priceless.  Keyword-based search engines can help with this, but they are inherently limited by varying terminologies between fields (i.e. jargon) and the need to know what kind of systems one wants to find.  These equation-based search engines enable researchers to find mathematical models using the most appropriate language: that of math.  They already know some of the ``synonyms'' of math (such as $a+b = b+a$), and will only improve with time.

    34: Another application of finding analogous systems is to explore what physical theories might connect systems which are found to be analogous.  For instance, one might find patterns for merging gravitation with quantum physics, by searching physics publications for quantum or gravity equations.  While this application is limited, so far (because the math-aware search engines are not yet advanced enough to identify mathematically-equivalent notation), it still provides an excellent start.

    37: The form in which an equation is written can have significance.  For example, writing the Schrodinger equation as a probability current indicates that it might be under study as a fluid flow. While this particular format has a name (``probability current''), not all significant formats of equations have a name.  These un-named equations can be difficult to look up - as can some of the named ones - without knowing the jargon of the field.  Math-language search engines let researchers get around the jargon, during the search phase.

    47: Long-ago learned equations might be remembered for their application, but the formula and name can be difficult to fully bring to mind.  If enough of an formula is remembered, it can be looked up in a math-aware search engine to (hopefully) find the full version of that formula. \cite{MWS-05-2012}

    56: 
>   57: \subsection{Look up the meaning of unfamiliar math notation}
    58: Especially when doing interdisciplinary research, it is easy for a researcher to come across notation which he or she is unfamiliar with.  The context is not always explained adequately, in the text, for that researcher to easily find the notation's meaning: field's conventions and ``common knowledge'' are often not stated in publications. \cite{DavenportEtAl2003, Rec-and-retrieval-rev}  Math-aware search engines which use equations' structure (i.e. ``Presentation-based'') to search for results can be used to find more information about the unfamiliar notation.  For example, the search engine ``Tangent'' proposes this application as a use of its software for both students and researchers \cite{Tangent-thesis}; for students, they give the example that the binomial coefficient's notation ($^4_2$) could be drawn in $m_{in}$ (section \ref{sec:min-description}) and subsequently searched for \cite{Tangent-pub-2015,Wangari-et-al_2014_paper}.  For researchers, an application might be to look up why $\pi(2) = 1$, which applies when discussing the ``prime counting function''. \cite{Wangari-et-al_2014_paper}

    84: Writing an equation in a new way can also elucidate paths towards solving it.  A simple example of this in everyday research is the use of substitutions in integrals, or integration by parts.  Finding other researchers' writings of an equation gives the researcher an opportunity to see what other forms of writing other researchers might have found useful: it gives them direction towards finding a potential solution.

   108: Routing of results - that is, updating users when new documents are available which includes their equation query - is one proposed use of math-aware search engines, by \cite{Youssef-Roles}.  When journal articles comprise the database, this would mean that researchers can set up ``alerts'' to be sent to them when a new article with a certain equation is published (and is indexed into the search system's database).

   470: To gain an insightful understanding regarding the generation quality of our method, we present three typical examples in Table~\ref{tab:examples}. The first two are selected from EXEQ-300k\footnote{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2431575}$^,$\footnote{ https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/752067} and the last one is selected from OFEQ-10k\footnote{https://mathoverflow.net/questions/291434}. From the examples, we see that the generated headlines and the human-written headlines have comparability and similarity. Generally, the generated headlines are coherent, grammatical, and informative.

   259: All of the above is a bunch of examples showing what is math useful to us as a species, as a community. But of course, we may ask ourselves if math knowledge should not be simply limited to mathematicians, engineers abd other people who may use it in their work for the benefit of the community at large. After all, we do not need people know exactly how a bridge is constructed, how a TV works, or how to repair a broken engine. For that, we use people who know how to do. Why should math be different?

Alas, the outcome of elections is far from being determined from what voters think, and the electoral system is crucial for the result. This is exactly the reason why politicans spend so much time discussing the electoral system. This subsection is mainly based on my paper \cite{SS}, on mathematical paradoxes of elections. I refer the reader to that paper  for greater details.

Showing the utility of something may make want some students to learn something, but most of them will be simply bored as hell.

However, to make contact with Floer theory, we will need to examine a hyper-slice of $M_4$, which we can topologically regard as $M_3 \times \mathbb{R}^- \cup_{M_3} M_3 \times \mathbb{R}^+$.

    21: Pre-university math problems have received increasing attention from the AI research community, with benchmarks such as SVAMP \cite{svamp} for elementary-level math, secondary school-level GSM8K \cite{cobbe2021training} offers diverse solution templates, and the MATH \cite{hendrycks2021measuring} dataset provides complex reasoning for tertiary/olympiad problems along with step-by-step solutions. Recently, interest has grown in other tertiary math topics like geometry problems and mathematical theorem proving \cite{sachan-etal-2019-discourse, chen-etal-2022-unigeo}. Additionally, automatic question generation (QG) in education has gained attention for enhancing teaching activities \cite{Kurdi2019ASR}. Additionally, in education, QG has gained attention with the use of LLMs, particularly ChatGPT, has gained significant interest for generating practice questions in various subjects \cite{Wang2022TowardsHE, Kasneci2023ChatGPTFG}. However, its potential for generating pre-university mathematics problems remains largely unexplored. This study, therefore, evaluates ChatGPT's performance using three well-established datasets: SVAMP, GSM8K, and MATH, covering pre-university grades and various difficulty levels.

   460: Despite explicit constraints outlined in the prompt template regarding repetition, the model occasionally reiterates random segments (tertiary-level) or the whole context (lower-levels). This repetition leads to the generation of overly lengthy questions, as exemplified by instances such as: ``Context: \emph{A football team played 22 games. They won 8 more than they lost.''}, ``Generated Question: \emph{How many games did the football team win if they played 22 games and won 8 more than they lost?''}. Subsequent human evaluations unveil that this issue predominantly afflicts the GSM8K dataset, occurring about 50\% of the time.

This behavior occurs irrespective of the context's complexity, resulting in the generation of simplistic questions that merely require looking up information in the context itself. For instance, when the context is as straightforward as \emph{``Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11''}, ChatGPT redundantly repeats the entire context and asks, \emph{``What is the ratio of Darrell’s age to Allen’s age?''}. While this phenomenon occurs less frequently than (4), about 5\% of the generated questions.

Although both sets of subjects are intricate mathematical disciplines, they exhibit notable differences in the nature of their posed questions. Questions in the MMMU dataset often involve advanced college-level mathematical concepts such as Kruskal’s algorithm, alternating group structures, and DFS Spanning Tree. In contrast, the questions in our dataset predominantly comprise puzzles that are readily solvable by middle and high school students.

   109:  
>  110: \paragraph{MM-MATH presents substantial challenges for current LMMs} From the evaluation results, we find that the most representative closed-source model to date, GPT-4o, performed the best across the board, achieving an average accuracy of 31.8\%, which significantly outperformed the best open-source model, InternVL-4B-Chat-1.5, with an average accuracy of 11.6\%. However, compared to the human-level baseline of 80.4\%, this best performance of the LMM still remains substantial room for improvement by 48.6\%.

   112: 
>  113: \paragraph{LMMs gain limited benefits from visual contexts} Another notable observation is that LMMs with the text-only setups (\emph{i.e.,} only questions as inputs) exhibit only slight degradation in performance compared to the multimodal setups (\emph{i.e.,} questions and images as inputs). For example, there are differences of 4.2\%, 2.7\%, and 0.8\% for the models GPT-4o, GPT-4v, and Claude-3-Opus, respectively. This result suggests that current LMMs primarily rely on linguistic knowledge to solve mathematical problems, and their utilization of visual contexts is limited. Detailed case studies are provided in Appendix~\ref{text reasoning}.

This result indicates that the proposed evaluation dimensions exhibit a significant differentiation across three difficulty levels, making it more beneficial for exploring the capability shortcomings of models. In addition, the three types of knowledge points also provide us with opportunities to understand the capabilities of models from different fine-grained perspectives.

Intriguingly, among closed-source LMMs---GPT-4o, GPT-4V, Claude-3-Opus, Gemini-Pro-V, and Qwen-VL-Max---the proportion of errors in image recognition are highly consistent, around 57\%.

   161: 
>  162: \paragraph{Multimodal models exhibit poor use of theorems during reasoning} We find that reasoning errors in large language models (LLMs) are often due to the incorrect application of theorems, accounting for about 40\% of overall errors. Misuse or omission of theorems misleads these LMMs, leading to errors (e.g., GPT-4V misuses the cosine rule, resulting in no solution, as detailed in Appendix~\ref{Misapplication of Theorems}). 
   163: Unlike image understanding, we find that a larger model size effectively helps reduce reasoning errors in the model.

This suggests that the text-based capabilities of LMMs are not the bottleneck in solving multimodal mathematical problems. Instead, we should focus more on fine-grained recognition and reasoning of visual content to enhance the capabilities of LMMs.

>  684: \paragraph{Finding a needle in the haystack.} In an attempt to make the \textit{question validation} step robust to as many failure modes as possible, we come up with a long and sophisticated prompt (see Appendix~\ref{app:prompt_val} for an example of this prompt). To elaborate, the validation prompt comprises of 1.) skill descriptions consisting of 3 exemplars for each of the 2 skills, 2.) 6 very long validation exemplars 3.) rest of the prompt consisting of the 7 conditions described in Section~\ref{sec:ques_val}. In prior iterations of the validation prompt, the names of the two skills which are supposed to be combined in the question, were mentioned only once throughout the prompt. In such a case, we observed that more often than not, model confused the pair of skills at hand, with skills mentioned in the validation exemplars. We also observed cases where the model was unable to locate the original skill names, came up with its own skill names depending on the skill exemplars provided in the skill descriptions. More specifically, while checking the question for \textbf{Dual Skill Requirement} in Section~\ref{sec:ques_val}, the models would check the question for the presence of skills distinct from the pair of skills at hand. We attribute this phenomenon to the the \textit{lost in the middle} or \textit{finding a needle in the haystack} challenges faced by LLMs. We provide an example of the phenomenon below. Notice how in Point 3 of the reasoning trace the model checks the question for the presence of two completely unrelated skills. We were able to nearly eliminate this problem by replacing referential terms (such as \textit{above given skills}, \textit{these skills}, etc.) to the two skills by the skill names.

An ideal method would fall in the top right of these plots, meaning GSM8K accuracy increases while non-math performance is maintained. As shown in these figures, scaling parameters identified by MathNeuro results in a GSM8K performance increase of 4-17\% across models, while scaling Wanda-identified parameters tends to either harm or slightly improve performance. As with pruning, LAPE performs inconsistently in the scaling setting across models. Scaling random parameters can help for some models, although the effect is not consistent across models. Each parameter identification method does not harm performance on RACE or MMLU, suggesting scaling's impact tends to be localized to math performance. %The GSM8K performance gains from scaling parameters identified by MathNeuro and the lack of catastrophic forgetting are consistent across models and highlight the potential for future work to utilize these parameters for interventions.

    69: We next explore if MathNeuro consistently identifies the same parameters as math-specific across different random subsets from a math and non-math dataset. This allows us to identify if math reasoning is in fact reliably concentrated in a subset of model parameters like the experiments above suggest. We first identify math-specific parameters using MathNeuro on two different random subsets from a math and non-math dataset. Next, we calculate the percentage overlap between the parameters identified in both subsets. We do this five times for different sample sizes (1, 10, 100, 500, and 1,000) and for calculating different proportions of top parameters from each dataset. This allows us to construct confidence intervals and see how parameter identification consistency varies when calculating based on different sample sizes and top parameter proportions. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:race_consistency} and Appendix \ref{sec:mmlu_param_location_number}, with 100 or more samples, roughly 95\% or more of the parameters MathNeuro identifies overlap between two random subsets regardless of the proportion of top parameters calculated, which shows that the method is able to consistently identify the most important parameters for math performance and that these parameters are largely invariant with regard to the subset of data used to calculate them.

    20: While naively identifying the parameters with the highest absolute value of weights times activations may find parameters important for a given task, it may not isolate the parameters important for that task \textit{only}, as discussed above. Thus, we calculate parameter importance for other unrelated tasks and use the disjoint set between these sets of parameters as the ones that are math-specific, which is the critical innovation of MathNeuro. To do this, we separately sum\footnote{This summation is akin to gradient-based identification methods summing gradients over inputs (e.g., \citealt{das_unified_2023}).} the absolute value of weights times activations for each parameter in attention and MLP layers for each data point $k$ across $N$ samples from a math dataset and an unrelated natural language task dataset. We focus on attention and MLP layers because recent work has found that knowledge and skills are often distributed in these two model components \cite{wei_does_2024, yin_lofit_2024}. Using this formulation, we compute scores for each parameter over math and non-math inputs:

   207: Event data is commonly modelled via Temporal Point Processes (TPPs), which describe stochastic processes of discrete events. Each event is composed of a time of occurrence $t \in \mathbb{R}^+$ and an event type $u \in U$ forming a pair $(t, u)$. $U$ is a finite set of discrete event types.

As we would do for word embeddings, we create a sequence of one-hot encoded vectors from the event types $\{u_i\}^L_{i=0}$ as $\mathbf{Y} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times V}$. Thus, the event-type embedding $\mathbf{E} = \mathbf{Y} \mathbf{L} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d}$ and the input embedding $\mathbf{U}$ is defined as $\mathbf{U} =\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{P} \in \mathbb{R}^{L \times d}$

The loss coefficients were set to \(\alpha = 1\) and \(\beta = 1\). The model architecture included 12 attention heads, 6 layers, and a feature size of 600, utilizing the GELU activation function in all feed-forward layers. We employed the AdamW optimizer with a batch size of 192 and a sequence length of 258, resulting in approximately 34 million parameters. It is important to note that on all experiments we fixed the same number of parameters when introducing news embeddings for all evaluated model to provide a fair comparison, same for Epredictor. The training data was split into $85\%$ training and $15\%$ testing without up-sampling, and random events were injected with a probability of \(p = 0.05\) per sample. On average, each training session lasted about 20 hours on an Nvidia A10G GPU.

Therefore, problems with multiple choice answers pose a problem: the model can inadvertently respond with the correct answer option (generally between a 25-50\% chance of guessing correctly) without providing the correct intermediate reasoning steps, leading to a poor learning signal. For this reason, we choose to remove any problems that are multiple choice, True/False, and Yes/No.

   144: \noindent \textbf{Different Question Types.} We compare the performance of various models on three types of questions. As shown in~\Cref{fig: lidar}(right), the accuracy of the model on multiple-choice questions is significantly higher than on free-form questions. We design two evaluation metrics for multi-step questions: Step Accuracy Rate (\textbf{SAR}) and Question Completeness Rate (\textbf{QCR}). SAR refers to the proportion of correctly answered steps out of the total steps, while QCR is the proportion of questions for which all steps were answered correctly. The model with the best performance on the QCR metric is GPT-4o, achieving only 6\%, while its corresponding SAR is 32.6\%. This reflects the model's insufficient ability to perform complex reasoning on open and multi-step questions, and also reveals that the multiple-choice question format may not truly reflect the model's actual reasoning and problem-solving ability, as they usually rely on prompts to identify options.

To maintain consistency and reduce label fragmentation, any out-of-taxonomy label is reassigned to the category Other, ensuring a coherent and structured category distribution.

The data mixture spans eight broad content categories: web crawl, mathematics, Wikipedia, code, academic publications, high quality crawl subset (Crawl++), multilingual corpora, and synthetic instruction-style datasets. The Crawl++ category aggregates curated web-derived sources such as OpenWebText, BigScience, and Reddit. The multilingual component covers nine languages: Spanish, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Russian. To construct the mixtures, \citet{nvidia2025nemotronhfamilyaccurateefficient} applied uniform weighting within datasets of the same quality tier, and they assigned greater weight to datasets of higher quality.

   115: 
>  116: \paragraph{AI for mathematical problem solving.}
   117: The use of large language models for math problem solving began with grade- and high-school level mathematics \cite{cobbe2021trainingverifierssolvemath, hendrycks2021measuringmathematicalproblemsolving}. LLMs quickly progressed from solving a handful of problems to saturating the benchmarks due to increased problem-solving abilities \cite{bubeck2023sparksartificialgeneralintelligence}. To address this gap, more challenging benchmarks containing PhD and competition-level mathematics emerged \cite{gulati2025putnamaxiomfunctionalstaticbenchmark, tsoukalas2024putnambenchevaluatingneuraltheoremprovers, glazer2025frontiermathbenchmarkevaluatingadvanced, ai-mathematical-olympiad-prize, ai-mathematical-olympiad-progress-prize-2}. Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), trained with Reinforcement Learning techniques to utilize additional compute at inference-time, quickly rose to this challenge. LRMs from providers like DeepMind \cite{DeepMind2025GeminiGold}, Harmonic \cite{achim2025aristotleimolevelautomatedtheorem}, and OpenAI \cite{openai2025o3o4mini} achieved Gold medal-level performance at the 2025 International Mathematics Olympiad. These accomplishments complement a parallel line of computer-assisted discovery systems (e.g., FunSearch \cite{veličković2024amplifyinghumanperformancecombinatorial}, AlphaTensor \cite{AlphaTensor2022}, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolvecodingagentscientific}), which demonstrated that search, learning, and symbolic tools can together yield novel or improved results. Despite these achievements, these systems share one feature: the solving and discovery models engage in occurs for problems \emph{posed by humans}, and thus they are not evaluated at judging problems.

   123: 
>  124: \paragraph{Human interestingness judgments.} Previous work in cognitive science has attempted to build models of what humans find interesting, and ultimately, what drives human curiosity \cite{Loewenstein1994Curiosity, hy_day_curiosity}. Some experiments studied students' reactions to irregular patterns \cite{berlyne1963complexity} and complex shapes \cite{day1967evaluations}, linking how they judged interestingness to complexity, novelty, and incongruity, and how these factors shape exploratory behavior. Studies done within mathematics specifically explore expert appraisals of what makes a proof ``beautiful'' \cite{10.1093/philmat/nku014}. Attempts to build artificially intelligent mathematical systems, including AMD systems such as Graffiti \cite{Colton1999AutomaticCF}, AM \cite{COLTON2000351, Lenat1976AMAA}, HR \cite{Colton1999AutomaticCF, COLTON2000351}, and GT \cite{epstein1987}, operationalized ``interestingness'' via large sets of hand-coded heuristics, which enabled early progress but limited scalability and adaptability across domains. While research in cognitive science has tried to explain how humans judge interestingness, work involving AMD systems often manually imbues these systems with problem features humans deem interesting. While not the primary focus in this work, our data collection and analyses also raise new questions of how people decide what problems are even worth solving~\citep{getzels1982problem, nickles1981problem, chu2025makes, collins2025people, wong2025meta}.  % In our work, we draw on techniques from both cognitive science and artificial intelligence to study how human and LLM judgments of interestingness in math problems compare. %[todo: last sentence needs work]

   156: We recruit 63 participants from Prolific, a crowdsourcing platform common in cognitive science~\citep{palan2018prolific}. Each participant was assigned to one of 2 conditions, rating 10 problems each. Each participant saw the same control problems and either a problem's original version or its variant. Participants were required to think about each problem for at least 1 minute before rating its \emph{interestingness} and \emph{difficulty} on a scale of 0-100, and providing a \mbox{1- to 3-sentence} rationale for each rating. For analysis, we filter out participants that rate the negative control math problem (``What is 28 + 13?'') as having interestingness > 90, which filtered out the 6 outlier participants' responses.

   164: 
>  165: \paragraph{IMO data collection.} We conducted a survey of interestingness judgements made by participants at the 2024 IMO. Each of the 48 survey participants saw 4 problems. Each participant saw the same baseline: problem 1 from IMO 2024. The rest of the problems were selected randomly from IMO shortlists, with each participant survey being unique and including problems from the same area (Algebra, Combinatorics, Number Theory, and Geometry). The participants were asked if they wanted to see the solution to the problem before rating its \emph{interestingness} and \emph{difficulty}. They were also asked to select reasons for their interestingness and uninterestingness rating from a multiple choice list (see Appendix~\ref{app:imo-reasons}), plus an additional free-text box to state their own reasons. Most problems only received 1 to 2 responses; this is too few to compare human and model judgments at a per-problem level. As such, for the bulk of this paper, all IMO data comparisons are made over the interestingness \textit{criteria} that participants selected.

>  183: \paragraph{On average, LLM judgments of interestingness and difficulty are correlated with human judgments.} For each LLM, we compute the $R^2$ between per-problem mean interestingness in humans and the model (see Figure~\ref{fig:prolific-heatmaps-t1.0}).%  Each cell shows the squared correlation between the row and column agents’ mean ratings; the diagonal is $100$ by definition. 
   184: The human row/column reveal model–human agreement, while other row/column combinations report correlations amongst the models. On the Prolific dataset, model–human $R^2$ ranges from about 0.48 to 0.78, with the strongest agreements from the Mistral family. Split-half human $R^2$—our noise ceiling on explainable variance—is 0.71 (see Appendix~\ref{app:human_noise_ceiling}).  This indicates that current LLMs (especially those in the Mistral family) are able to approximate human perceptions of interestingness with surprising fidelity.
