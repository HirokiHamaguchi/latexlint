\section{LLAlignEnd}

The following ends with a line break.
\begin{gather*}
	f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\
	g(x) = dx^2 + ex + f \\
\end{gather*}
The following does not end with a line break.
\begin{align*}
	f(x) & = ax^2 + bx + c \\
	g(x) & = dx^2 + ex + f
\end{align*}
Here is the next line after the align environment.
