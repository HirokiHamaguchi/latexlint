    91: %Our work brokers the combination of these approaches (making them more consonant with each other) in order to develop a coherent, experimentally-validated, and predictive theory of students' use of mathematics in physics that can be used across contexts, modalities, and levels.

>   93: Our work grows out of this latter tradition. In the course of analyzing video of upper-division students solving problems {\it in situ}, we noticed that they shift between sense-making activities and activities whose sole purpose appears to be ``doing math.'' We are interested in investigating: how do students collectively set up the problem and determine that they are ready to "just do math"? how (if at all) do students reflect upon and interpret the result they get from doing the math?  To answer these questions we need to be able to reliably identify when students are ``just doing math." To this end, we have conducted a preliminary study where we leveraged the epistemic frame construct \cite{Scherr:2009gm,Irving:2013bi}. We have identified markers in students' behaviors and discourse that are indicative of students "just doing math."
    94: 
    95: In this paper, we describe the features of this new epistemic frame (e-frame), \JM. We distinguish \JM~from a related e-frame and discuss how this distinction has important implications for our future work.

And give them some gentle nudges (metaphorical wires) to disentangle the key concepts of Mathematics from the spiraling unfolding of real phenomena? And ultimately recover the platonic nature of Math?

The first staging of this exhibition was developed at the Triennale di Milano from 14 September 2014 to 23 November 2014 with more than 40,000 visitors. Curated by Gilberto Bini, Maria Ded\`o, Simonetta Di Sieno (Center "matematita", University of Milan) and Renato Betti, Angelo Guerraggio (Centro PRISTEM, University L. Bocconi), the exhibition was organized by the Center "matematita" and the Centro PRISTEM in collaboration with Dr. Vincenzo Napolano (INFN) and sponsored, among others, by many Mathematics Departments of the major Italian universities. The second set up of the exhibition was made at {\it Muse} - Museum of Science (Trento) from 26 February to 26 June 2016. Marco Andreatta (CIRM-FBK, Muse and Department of Mathematics, Trento) was an additional curator of this second set-up.

>  193: \section{The visitors' impressions} \label{sec4} Multimedia installations and interwoven threads were not the only factors of success for the first set-up of the exhibition \textit{MadeInMath}. The animators were of crucial importance because they were mediators between organizers and visitors. Master students in various degrees in science (Mathematics, Biology, Physics, etc.) have been trained on the topics covered by the exhibition to accompany the many school-groups, but also to follow individual visitors, or small groups of hesitant visitors. For animators it was undoubtedly a formative moment for their training and their personal growth. Each of them, in fact, was free to propose their reading of the contents of the exhibition because the exhibition has various interpretations and visits had different cuts. People reported that they visited it twice and had different impressions each time. The ability to create connections between seemingly unrelated issues is one of the most powerful activity of mathematics, which gave the show an edge. It was thanks to all these facets that each visitor could grasp interesting aspects depending on their age, their training and their own interests. As commented in \cite{tg} by one of the animators, Maurizio Giaffredo, each of us animators took away a wealth of meetings and reflections whose value derives from the diversity of people and ideas that we had the chance to meet. In just two weeks the exhibition was visited by over 40,000 visitors. Of these, about 18,000 were students, mostly from middle and  high school. This means that more than half of the visitors fall into the category `general public`, which was quite a success. Beyond the figures, it was impressive to experience a high level of satisfaction by visitors. An initial indicator in this regard was to see students on a visit with the class during the week and then see them again at the weekend with their parents or other friends to illustrate some of the content of the exhibition as if they were young guides. A second indicator comes from the evidence left by visitors. Let us quote some of the thousands that people delighted in leaving. One of them says: "We knew the beauty of mathematics, but we did not suspect that  it was so beautiful. Thank you also for the love and attention to the teacher's figure". In fact, part of the exhibition gave space to the admirable work done every day by teachers, in this case those of mathematics. We were particularly pleased that this aspect has been apprehended and appreciated. Further evidence comes from some foreign visitors, who wrote: "I wish I had paid more attention to math class!" indicating the fact that the exhibition has managed to somehow overcome the misconception regarding mathematics and bring in the foreground some of the fundamental aspects of the teaching of mathematics (but not only), such as curiosity, wonder and the transmission of important ideas and not only tedious techniques. In this regard, a visitor wrote that he/she discovered a new world. In this sense, the initial disorientation was overcome in an unexpected and positive way because the exhibition succeeded in unveiling the potential of mathematics, which previously seemed unattainable. Another witness is grateful for the many ideas and so many hints that would be used at school for events on the subject of mathematics. There have also been some criticism, sometimes because of the difficulty in understanding certain topics. For this, as we discussed before, the guides were really fundamental because they played a role as a cultural mediator. The comments regarding some guides have been very positive, as, for example, "The exhibition is very beautiful but the enthusiasm of our guide was exceptional". Finally, we would like to quote a comment by a visitor, probably very young, that after the visit wrote that the exhibition was better than \textit {Gardaland} (an amusement park)!

For animators it was undoubtedly a formative moment for their training and their personal growth. Each of them, in fact, was free to propose their reading of the contents of the exhibition because the exhibition has various interpretations and visits had different cuts. People reported that they visited it twice and had different impressions each time. The ability to create connections between seemingly unrelated issues is one of the most powerful activity of mathematics, which gave the show an edge. It was thanks to all these facets that each visitor could grasp interesting aspects depending on their age, their training and their own interests. As commented in \cite{tg} by one of the animators, Maurizio Giaffredo, each of us animators took away a wealth of meetings and reflections whose value derives from the diversity of people and ideas that we had the chance to meet. In just two weeks the exhibition was visited by over 40,000 visitors. Of these, about 18,000 were students, mostly from middle and  high school. This means that more than half of the visitors fall into the category `general public`, which was quite a success. Beyond the figures, it was impressive to experience a high level of satisfaction by visitors. An initial indicator in this regard was to see students on a visit with the class during the week and then see them again at the weekend with their parents or other friends to illustrate some of the content of the exhibition as if they were young guides. A second indicator comes from the evidence left by visitors. Let us quote some of the thousands that people delighted in leaving. One of them says: "We knew the beauty of mathematics, but we did not suspect that  it was so beautiful. Thank you also for the love and attention to the teacher's figure". In fact, part of the exhibition gave space to the admirable work done every day by teachers, in this case those of mathematics. We were particularly pleased that this aspect has been apprehended and appreciated. Further evidence comes from some foreign visitors, who wrote: "I wish I had paid more attention to math class!" indicating the fact that the exhibition has managed to somehow overcome the misconception regarding mathematics and bring in the foreground some of the fundamental aspects of the teaching of mathematics (but not only), such as curiosity, wonder and the transmission of important ideas and not only tedious techniques. In this regard, a visitor wrote that he/she discovered a new world. In this sense, the initial disorientation was overcome in an unexpected and positive way because the exhibition succeeded in unveiling the potential of mathematics, which previously seemed unattainable. Another witness is grateful for the many ideas and so many hints that would be used at school for events on the subject of mathematics. There have also been some criticism, sometimes because of the difficulty in understanding certain topics. For this, as we discussed before, the guides were really fundamental because they played a role as a cultural mediator. The comments regarding some guides have been very positive, as, for example, "The exhibition is very beautiful but the enthusiasm of our guide was exceptional". Finally, we would like to quote a comment by a visitor, probably very young, that after the visit wrote that the exhibition was better than \textit {Gardaland} (an amusement park)!

However, given the limited options available for this, it might be easier to copy the relevant equations' pictures and upload them to a software which translates them into LaTeX.  Although many LaTeX to MathML translators exist online (e.g. MathMLCentral \cite{mathmlcentral}, MathToWeb \cite{mathtoweb}, LaTeX2MathML \cite{latex2mathml}, TeXZilla \cite{texzilla}), no operational web-hosted services for MathML to LaTeX could be found (one example of an inoperative one is “MathML to TeX online Translator “ \cite{orccaMathMLtoLatex}).  There are a couple of desktop solutions, although there seems to be no working desktop software.  One solution is to use the github-hosted program web-XSLT \cite{webxslt}: there are no usage instructions included, but the developer specified on a forum that it should be used with Saxon (or a different xslt2 engine) and run via the command ``java -jar saxon9.jar myfile.xml pmml2tex.xsl'' \cite{webxsltStEx}.

R. L.

If the gap is actually smaller than the continuum length scale, then there is a failure of the continuum hypothesis in this boundary condition.

Viscous effects on the wall, which is a pre-requisite for flow separation leading to the formation of vortex is completely absent in equation \eqref{bi}.  We have also reiterated in our original work \cite{kal18} that one of the sources of this non-physical result is the discontinuity of the boundary conditions at $r=0$, ie., at the corner and  failure of equation \eqref{bi} in adhering to the continuum hypothesis on which the foundation of Navier-Stokes equation is built upon. R. L. Panton, in his highly acclaimed book {\bf Incompressible flows} \cite{pan} concurs with our views: citing a specific case of Stokes flow in corners, he states that the remedy of removing this discontinuity lies in solving another problem that allows for a small gap at the corner (the junction of the walls). If the gap is actually smaller than the continuum length scale, then there is a failure of the continuum hypothesis in this boundary condition.

This is a completely vague, out of the context and misleading statement, and there is no connection between the notion of infiniteness/ finiteness and a solution being analytic at the corner. Most of the books on elementary differential equations \cite{sne,john,zan,chil} would reveal that a boundary value problem (BVP) in a bounded domain contains two separate set of equations, one valid at the interior requiring it to be analytic or regular, and the other set of equations being prescribed at the boundaries. Equation \eqref{bi} or for that matter the equations under scrutiny in \cite{kal18,bakker,delery,ghil,hir,wang,wu}  are no different from them.

   107: The differential equations in the context of the current discussion pertain to a closed physical domain bounded by solid walls. Analyticity of the solution at the boundaries of such bounded domains (which invariably includes the corner) is not guaranteed because the derivative of a function is not defined at the boundaries. Owing to this, analytic functions are always defined on an open set.

>  108: For the benefit of the readers, we offer a few lines from the book {\bf Complex variables and applications} by Brown and Churchill \cite{bro} on the definition of an analytic function: "A function $f$ of the complex variable $z$ is analytic in an open set if it has derivative at each point in that set. If we should speak of a function $f$ that is analytic in a set $S$ which is not open, it is to be understood that $f$ is anlytic in an open set containing $S$. In particular, $f$ is {\it analytic at a point $z_0$} if it is analytic in a neighbourhood of $z_0$." Opting to go for a complex function above arises out of the fact that the solution of \eqref{bi} in \cite{sh18,dean,moff2} is in the form of a complex variable.
   109: 
   110: Nowhere in the theorems of \cite{kal18} and the theorems preceding it \cite{bakker,delery,ghil,hir,wang,wu} state the solution of  Navier-Stokes equations to be analytic at the corner. Note that the geometric theorems on incompressible viscous flows \cite{ghil,wang} consider a divergence free vector field as the solution at the interior (which is regular in an open set) of a bounded domain and Dirichlet or Neumann condition at the boundaries. The two main proofs in \cite{kal18} do not use the concept of analytic functions as solutions at all. Moreover, the concepts in \cite{bakker,delery,ghil,hir,wang,wu} which are used to derive the alternative proofs of finiteness in \cite{kal18}, employ regular functions defined in an open subset, and hence are devoid of analyticity requirements at the boundary, which the corner is a part of. The endeavour of connecting the notion of finiteness and a solution being analytic at the corners is therefore completely far fetched.

>  112: The very definition of vortex requires \cite{hal} the rotational effect in the immediate neighbourhood of the vortex center. As such the circulation \cite{white,batch} of the vortex must be non zero. On the other hand, a vortex with zero length scale will naturally render a zero circulation for a vortex and hence would fail to satisfy the definition of a vortex. Therefore the smallest length scale that can be accommodated in the so called infinite sequence of vortices must be non-zero, even if smaller than the Kolomogorov length scale. This scale was used in the main proofs on finiteness in \cite{kal18} to signify a non zero length scale only. Any such length scale (referred to as $\eta$ in \cite{kal18}, page 10-11), be it Kolmogorov or anything else, is sufficient to ensure the finiteness.  Thus the claim by the author of reference \cite{sh18} that the notion of finiteness ``is not even heuristically valid if there are geometric length scales which are smaller than the Kolmogorov scale" is an invalid one. 
   113: 
   114: The above brings us to another point raised in \cite{sh18}, that the authors (of \cite{kal18}) had not offered or referred to any proof of the statement ``A vortex scale cannot be smaller than Kolmogorov length scale". A close examination of \cite{kal18} would reveal that no such statement was made thereat; rather it was stated that ``the Kolmogorov theory \cite{wal} asserts that eddies below a certain size cannot be formed." However, Shtern \cite{sh18} avoids making any comments on the justification provided in the last paragrpah of section 2.3.1  pertaining to Kolmogorov length scale in \cite{kal18}. Under the same geometric configuration, for a flow undergoing laminar to turbulent transition, can the smallest possible laminar scale  be smaller than the smallest turbulent scale defined by the Kolmogorov scale? The answer is a clear no, which comes from experimental and numerical evidences. For example, the visualization of flow past bluff bodies at high Reynolds numbers, where the flow is laminar just behind the body initially and becomes turbulent in the downstream region away from the body  later on (see the visualizations  in \cite{dyke,zad1,zad2}, Chapter 7 of \cite{white} Chapters 5, 6 of \cite{white1}). Another example in this context is the visualization of flows arising out of plane jets at different Reylonds numbers depicting the laminar and turbulent  regimes \cite{sur,tenn}. Just behind the jets, the turbulent length scales are much smaller than the laminar ones here. Recall that the concept of the Kolmogorov length scale comes from the cascading effect where energy is transferred from larger to smaller eddies. Laminar eddies are not small enough to accommodate the mixing of the eddies to facilitate the transfer of energy \cite{white1}.

>   14: The Galois theory today is based on automorphisms of a field extension that leave the basic field invariant. Central in this theory is the well-known correspondence theorem usually proven with an Artin-Dedekind lemma. This article will provide a proof of this theorem which is inspired by ideas you can find in the \textit {M\'{e}moire sur les conditions de r\'{e}solubilit\'{e} des \'{e}quations par radicaux.} For translations see \cite{1,2,4}, for the original manuscript see \cite{3}.  The article also refers to the main theorem of the symmetric polynomials wich Galois also often uses. This article therefore shows that the motto \textit{"Read the masters"}$\footnote[1]{Edwards and Tignol support this motto.}$ works.\\\

     2: \textit{``It is foolish to answer a question that you do not understand. It is sad to work for an end that you do not desire}{\rm --- George Polya \cite{george1957solve}}.
>    3: According to Mathematician Polya's famous problem solving heuristics, asking general common sense questions about the problem  facilitates problem understanding. One such question is  ``What is the unknown?"~\cite{george1957solve}.  The unknown of a given problem is what the problem requires  to be worked out and solved.  In this paper, we propose computational models for extracting the unknown from  problem specifications.

>    6: In online tutorial communities, it is not uncommon to find  problems that include questions like ``what is the solution I  am looking for?"\footnote{\url{https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/66766/}}. Automated hints such as help with \textit{identifying the unknown}, could  provide timely support to self-directed learners ~\cite{guglielmino1978development,houle1988inquiring,hiemstra1994self}.  Furthermore, information about the unknown can be used as a feature in other tasks that can enhance self-directed learning, such as  similar-question retrieval ~\cite{DBLP:conf/naacl/LeiJBJTMM16}, and question-answer matching~\cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/ShenRJPTX17}, as well as in models for  automated problem solving~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/SachanDMRX18}.

This is likely due to the size of our dataset given that these methods have about twice as many parameters as the other methods, for example, CNN+Graph+LSTM has $2,980,018$ parameters vs. CNN+Graph with $1,502,386$.

   166: \section{Conclusions and Future Work}
>  167: Our new task, dataset, and  results are  only initial steps, and  pave the way for  future work. Beyond  ``what is the unknown?", we can  develop  models that ask other general common sense questions that can support the problem solving process. \citet{george1957solve}  presents a list of  more such questions. These questions are general,  future work includes working on problems from  topics other than Probability. Additionally,  future work can study who this line of work can benefit from well-studied aspects of   knowledge harvesting and representation~\cite{DBLP:conf/webdb/NakasholeTW10,theobald2010urdf,DBLP:conf/vlds/NakasholeSST12, nakashole2012automatic,kumar2017discovering}.

This application of math eventually led to the Nobel Prize for Medicine (in 1979) for the two and gave a huge tool of diagnosis to hospitals all around the world.

   144: \noindent To \gls{simulate} fish patterns, we need to tell the black and yellow cells where to appear in the checkerboard. In other words, we need to describe their rules of behavior. Biologists know that black cells mostly like to be near other black cells, and yellow cells like to have mostly yellow cells around them. We use this fact to build our \gls{model}. \\
   145: 
>  146: \noindent In Figure~\ref{fig:zebrafishModel}, each cell in the checkerboard has 4 sides (unless the cell is at a corner or an edge). Our rule is ``One side different, the rest the same." This means that if you put your finger on a yellow cell, one of the cells that it touches should be black (different) and the other cells should be yellow (the same). You can see some examples of cells that follow this rule and cells that don't in Figure~\ref{fig:zebrafishModel}. To get some practice with this rule, try filling in the worksheet in Table~\ref{fig:zebrafishTable} (answers are at the bottom of the table).\\
   147: 
   148: \noindent Our model has only one rule, and the truth is that we are simplifying all the ways that cells actually behave in zebrafish. But that's okay! When mathematicians make models, they start with simple rules and then build more realistic ones. Simple models help scientists learn, and our model is a first step. If you'd like to see more realistic models that mathematicians are working on now, check out the scientific study \cite{volkening2}.

   175: 
>  176: \noindent Turns out that zebrafish only \emph{usually} have stripes (hence the ``zebra" part of their name). As you know, stripes form because cells follow specific rules. But what happens if cells don't follow their normal rules? This can happen if a fish has a \gls{mutation} in its \gls{genes} \cite{IrionRev2019,ParichyRev2019}. In Figure~\ref{fig:zebrafishIntro}, image (g) is not the only picture of a zebrafish. Believe it or not, images (c) and (d) are also zebrafish, but they are mutants! \\
   177: 
   178: \noindent Mutant zebrafish have different patterns because their cells follow different rules. A fish's \gls{genes} specify these rules, so mutant \gls{genes} lead to mutant rules and mutant patterns. Humans can also have \gls{mutation}{\color{RubineRed}s} in their \gls{genes}, and this can cause disease. \\

They also expressed an interest in developing interactive teaching media but frequently lack the necessary skills (E3, E4, E5). Current authoring interfaces can be varied and complex, and instructors may not be well-versed in using them. E1 specifically stated, \textit{ "If you ask me to graph a piece wise function on GeoGebra right now, I wouldn't be able to do it"}.
   103: Our approach holds the potential to substantially reduce the authoring effort needed to create interactive materials. E1 also noted that our approach makes it especially easy to modify existing content rather than starting from scratch. All the experts we interviewed agreed that they could utilize our tool to produce relevant materials for their students. 
   104: Overall, our AR approach has the potential to make the creation of interactive materials more accessible and time-efficient for instructors.

>  107: Teachers frequently create customized content to align better with their curriculum and teaching objectives, building upon existing materials. \textit{"I would often just use specific images or drawings from textbooks and papers to explain a concept"} (E4). Our AR approach offers significant support in this area. During the interviews, instructors appreciated the system's ability to select from various augmentation techniques, enabling them to customize the augmented textbook according to their specific needs. This adaptability allows them to tailor the content to their course's learning objectives and their students' requirements. One expert (E1) found that integrating interactive websites into teaching can be challenging due to unfamiliarity with the site's functionalities or difficulties inputting functions into the system. Furthermore, comprehending the website's content and relating it back to the course material can also be challenging (E2). In contrast, our AR approach offers instructors more control over the material they are presenting (E1, E4). This control is particularly beneficial when teaching in front of a class, as customizing the material to suit specific teaching objectives is more desirable than using pre-animated content, such as videos (E1).
   108: Overall, our AR approach delivers an efficient and adaptable solution for instructors to create interactive materials that align with their teaching objectives and better engage their students.

Further research extends the reasoning capabilities of CoT by applying majority voting to improve self-consistency~\citep{wang2023selfconsistency}, choosing few-shot examples and output chains with more complex reasoning steps~\citep{fu2022complexity}, breaking down the problem to simpler sub-problems~\citep{zhou2023leasttomost}, or even expanding Chain-of-thought to Tree-of-Thoughts~\citep{Yao2023TreeOT}. Similar to Zero-shot-CoT, our method apply  “step by step"-like prompts to regularize \gptcode's use of code without the careful design of step-by-step few-shot examples. Additionally, We enhance majority voting to verification-guided weighted majority voting, leveraging the results of CSV as voting weights.

>  193: We prompt ChatGPT to generate QA pairs from \topicmath{} for our evaluation purposes. Our inference strategy involves using prompts that promote diversification in tokens, topic alignment, and difficulty. The algorithm is presented in Algorithm~\ref{alg:answer-unaware-qa-generation}. Specifically, we create a list of generated QA pairs for each lesson in \topicmath. Given a lesson, our prompt consists of its definition and the topic's name it belongs to, and one demonstration randomly selected from its list of generated QA pairs. After getting the newly generated QA pair, we accept it if its question has a ROUGE-L score less than $0.7$ with any of all the questions generated from all the lessons, otherwise, we filter it out. To promote token diversity in generating educational questions, we utilize two strategies.  For grades 1-8, we ask ChatGPT to enrich the generated questions by providing objects and stories via adding \texttt{"You could introduce characters, objects
   194: or scenarios to make your math problem context more diverse in terms of token"} to the prompts. For tertiary classes, the problems might be complicated and require more rigorous and abstract thinking. Therefore, instead of requiring a real-life context, we instruct the model to introduce more variables in naming the objects via supplementing \texttt{"Your questions are required to be diverse in terms of tokens, which can be achieved by paraphrasing the question or introducing/renaming variables"} to the prompts, so the abstract contexts could be generalized. We name our generated dataset from ChatGPT for evaluations as {\dataset}, consisting of $16K$ QA pairs. Our prompt template is below.

   103: \subsection{The \textit{Reacting to Errors} Lesson and Associated Criteria}
   104: % \begin{The Reacting to Errors Lesson and Associated Criteria}
>  105: In \textit{Reacting to Errors}, a tutor is required to respond to a student’s mistake in solving a math problem according to specified elements of appropriate responses as highlighted in research \citep{lepper2002wisdom, loewenberg2009work}.  These elements encompass praising the attempt or effort; subtly drawing attention to the mistake, and guiding the student toward self-correction \citep{lepper2002wisdom}. Any response that explicitly points out the student’s error, instructs the student on what exactly to do, or simply provides the correct answer is not desirable \citep{lepper1993motivational}. To assess a tutor’s response, we establish five criteria in line with the research-recommended approach. The tutor’s response should be: 1) process- or effort-focused, acknowledging the student’s effort; 2) motivating, avoiding negative language and encouraging the student to recognize the mistake on their own; 3) indirect in addressing the error, using leading questions without negative connotations, such as using words like “mistake” or “error” that may discourage the student; 4) immediate, remaining relevant to the problem at hand; and 5) sincere and accurate, such as ensuring truthful praise to the situation (e.g., praising a student for working hard only when they actually put forth effort) and being mathematically correct. Research suggests that students with high and low self-efficacy measures benefit differently from tutorial dialogue \citep{wiggins2017you}. Low-efficacy students may benefit more from an indirect and more subtle approach when reacting to errors than high-efficacy students, who may not be bothered by tutors calling direct attention to their mistakes. The proposed tutoring strategy is recommended for low-efficacy students, or students who historically struggle in math indicated by a history of low performance and proficiency.

   150: % \begin{Results}
>  151: \textbf{Large language models demonstrate proficiency in identifying criteria on how to best respond to students making an error, however, both models exhibit limitations in recognizing if an error was made.} In responding to RQ1 on the ability of LLMs to effectively identify criteria for tutors reacting to students making errors, both GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 performed fairly well. Table 2 displays the absolute performance of both models in assessing the criteria. GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 both did particularly well on the criteria of \textit{immediate} and \textit{accurate}, with F1 scores equal to or greater than 0.80 for both these criteria. We posit that these models were able to achieve high levels of accuracy in identifying these criteria as \textit{immediate} was quite straightforward to recognize. The tutor typically discussed situations relevant to the problem, and the \textit{accurate} criteria could be graded by simply ensuring well-established mathematical principles were followed. For the \textit{process-focused} and \textit{indirect} criteria, both models struggled a bit more, as shown by lower F1 scores relative to the rest of the criteria. We believe the models interpreted \textit{indirect} feedback to a student making an error as primarily focused on not giving away the correct response, allowing the terms “mistake” and “error” (e.g., a tutor saying,\textit{“You’re close, but there may be a small error”}), which are phrases our human graders found as discouraging in a tutoring session. The annotation guide for human graders (Appendix C) states, “The tutor avoids the use of words such as \textit{mistake} or \textit{error}.” However, the few-shot LLM prompt does not explicitly state tutors should avoid such terms and only provides examples of met criteria, such as “\textit{You have the right idea}” and “\textit{Explain to me what you did here.}”

The annotation guide for human graders (Appendix C) states, “The tutor avoids the use of words such as \textit{mistake} or \textit{error}.” However, the few-shot LLM prompt does not explicitly state tutors should avoid such terms and only provides examples of met criteria, such as “\textit{You have the right idea}” and “\textit{Explain to me what you did here.}”

If the student does not make an error, immediately score the transcript with a -1 and ignore the rest of the prompt. The following are criteria for assessing the tutor:\\
>  321: C1) Process or effort-focused-  meaning the tutor praises the student for effort, and not necessarily getting the answer correct. An example of effort-focused praise would be a tutor saying to a student, “I love how you worked hard on that problem,” “Really insightful attempt on that step,” or “Good work on that step”;\\
   322: C2) Motivating- such as encouraging the student by prompting the student to identify their own mistake. An example of motivating the student would be saying, “You’re doing very well,” “ Keep working hard as you are doing already,” or “You got this!”;\\

>  765: In this case, the model lists $9$ and $27$ as an even number, which leads to a false $(m,n)$ pair $(9,27)$. Moreover, the pairs $(6,54),(18,18)$, though satisfying the condition given by model prediction, do not meet the title requirements. The prediction just accidentally lists four pairs as answers. However, if the evaluation takes only the outcome into consideration, this sample will be "correct". 
   766: Similar cases appear more frequently as the difficulty level increases. Among these false positive cases, most problems have an integer as the answer, especially a single-digit number, and the solution can be carried out without detailed calculations or proof of cases. These make it easy for the model to speculate a correct answer excluding step-by-step reasoning. Simply judging model abilities only by outcome accuracy may be unilateral. Therefore, one of our future works is to use reward models or LEAN to provide a better process checking.

   430: that genuinely required applying two very distinct skills (as opposed to, say,  requiring primarily skill $i$, and mildly using  skill $j$). The discovered relationship suggests further that if we could create questions where each combines $k$ skills, we might see the relationship $Y \approx X^k$, which would tend to further magnify performance differences between models. 
   431: 
>  432: While minor deviations from $Y = X^2$ maybe attributed to noise and factors such as non-similar distribution of skills in MATH and MATH$^2$, it is noteworthy that three out of five of the recent ``thinking" models, namely o1-preview, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B show non-trivial positive deviations from this trend. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B shows the highest positive deviation of all models ($\sim10.5\%$ higher than what would be predicted by the trend). This suggests that the pre-dominantly RL-based post-training used in these models elicits more powerful reasoning and generalization capabilities. Claude-3.5 Sonnet and the MetaMath and MAmmoTH models on the other hand show the highest negative deviations from the trend suggesting overfitting.
   433: 
   434: %This also explains the previous observation that smaller models within the same family, observe larger drops (see Appendix~\ref{app:expts} for further discussion). We hypothesize that this relationship can be explained by the fact that the questions in the generated dataset consist of two skills at a time, as compared to questions in MATH, which consist of one skill.

> 1016: During the human verification process, the annotators were instructed to be on the look out for any errors in the questions and solutions generated by the models, and fix any lack of clarity, ambiguity, convoluted language, etc. in the generated questions which might confuse the model and reduce the “quality” of the questions. They were also instructed to look out for specific modifications which could make the questions more difficult. For further discussion on the human verification process, refer to Section~\ref{app:human_ann}. In Table~\ref{tab:ques_mod} we compare the performance of models on the questions which were modified against their performance on the questions which were not modified. 
  1017: %We also compare the performance of models on these two subsets with their performance on MATH Level-5 questions

  1015: \subsubsection{Modified Questions vs Non-Modified Questions}
> 1016: During the human verification process, the annotators were instructed to be on the look out for any errors in the questions and solutions generated by the models, and fix any lack of clarity, ambiguity, convoluted language, etc. in the generated questions which might confuse the model and reduce the “quality” of the questions. They were also instructed to look out for specific modifications which could make the questions more difficult. For further discussion on the human verification process, refer to Section~\ref{app:human_ann}. In Table~\ref{tab:ques_mod} we compare the performance of models on the questions which were modified against their performance on the questions which were not modified. 
  1017: %We also compare the performance of models on these two subsets with their performance on MATH Level-5 questions
  1018: MATH$^2$ questions which were modified by humans before being included in the dataset are more difficult, even when compared to the most difficult level of MATH (level 5).

Additionally, we include evaluations of proprietary models such as the proprietary ``thinking" model o1-preview~\cite{@o1}, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo\footnote{\texttt{gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09} at the time of writing} \citep{openai2023gpt4}, Gemini-1.5-Pro~\citep{team2024gemini}, Claude 3.5 Sonnet \footnote{\texttt{claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620} at the time of writing} and Claude-3 Opus\footnote{\texttt{claude-3-opus-20240229} at the time of writing}~\citep{anthropic2024claude3_5}. We compare the performances of these models on our generated questions (MATH$^2$) against their performance on the MATH dataset \citep{hendrycks2021measuring}.

This allows us to account for cases where incorrect reasoning traces lead to a correct final answer. Appendix~\ref{app:prompt_eval} shows the prompt used for evaluation. During response generation, we set the temperature to 0 and top\_p to 1 for all models. All necessary compute details are discussed in Appendix~\ref{app:expts}%For open source LLMs, 2 80GB A100 GPUs and 72GB of RAM to run inference facilitated by vLLM~\citep{kwon2023efficient}. For evaluating GPT-4 Omni and GPT-4 Turbo, we use 25 parallel workers to make the API calls, and for Claude-3 Opus we use 2 workers.

  2043: that genuinely required applying two very distinct skills (as opposed to, say,  requiring primarily skill $i$, and mildly using  skill $j$). The discovered relationship suggests further that if we could create questions where each combines $k$ skills, we might see the relationship $Y \approx X^k$, which would tend to further magnify performance differences between models. 
  2044: 
> 2045: While minor deviations from $Y = X^2$ maybe attributed to noise and factors such as non-similar distribution of skills in MATH and MATH$^2$, it is noteworthy that three out of five of the recent ``thinking" models, namely o1-preview, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B show non-trivial positive deviations from this trend. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B shows the highest positive deviation of all models ($\sim10.5\%$ higher than what would be predicted by the trend). This suggests that the pre-dominantly RL-based post-training used in these models elicits more powerful reasoning and generalization capabilities. Claude-3.5 Sonnet and the MetaMath and MAmmoTH models on the other hand show the highest negative deviations from the trend suggesting overfitting.
  2046: 
  2047: %This also explains the previous observation that smaller models within the same family, observe larger drops (see Appendix~\ref{app:expts} for further discussion). We hypothesize that this relationship can be explained by the fact that the questions in the generated dataset consist of two skills at a time, as compared to questions in MATH, which consist of one skill.

Additionally, we include evaluations of proprietary models such as the proprietary ``thinking" model o1-preview~\cite{@o1}, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo\footnote{\texttt{gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09} at the time of writing} \citep{openai2023gpt4}, Gemini-1.5-Pro~\citep{team2024gemini}, Claude 3.5 Sonnet \footnote{\texttt{claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620} at the time of writing} and Claude-3 Opus\footnote{\texttt{claude-3-opus-20240229} at the time of writing}~\citep{anthropic2024claude3_5}. We compare the performances of these models on our generated questions (MATH$^2$) against their performance on the MATH dataset \citep{hendrycks2021measuring}. We further report several ablation studies on MATH$^2$ in Appendix~\ref{app:expts}.

   390: For generating responses, we use the MAmmoTH \citep{yue2023mammoth} codebase. The responses are graded using a GPT-4 grader, where GPT-4 Omni checks the correctness of a solution response against the ground truth solution. This allows us to account for cases where incorrect reasoning traces lead to a correct final answer. Appendix~\ref{app:prompt_eval} shows the prompt used for evaluation. During response generation, we set the temperature to 0 and top\_p to 1 for all models. All necessary compute details are discussed in Appendix~\ref{app:expts}%For open source LLMs, 2 80GB A100 GPUs and 72GB of RAM to run inference facilitated by vLLM~\citep{kwon2023efficient}. For evaluating GPT-4 Omni and GPT-4 Turbo, we use 25 parallel workers to make the API calls, and for Claude-3 Opus we use 2 workers.

   424: that genuinely required applying two very distinct skills (as opposed to, say,  requiring primarily skill $i$, and mildly using  skill $j$). The discovered relationship suggests further that if we could create questions where each combines $k$ skills, we might see the relationship $Y \approx X^k$, which would tend to further magnify performance differences between models. 
   425: 
>  426: While minor deviations from $Y = X^2$ maybe attributed to noise and factors such as non-similar distribution of skills in MATH and MATH$^2$, it is noteworthy that three out of five of the recent ``thinking" models, namely o1-preview, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B show non-trivial positive deviations from this trend. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B shows the highest positive deviation of all models ($\sim10.5\%$ higher than what would be predicted by the trend). This suggests that the pre-dominantly RL-based post-training used in these models elicits more powerful reasoning and generalization capabilities. Claude-3.5 Sonnet and the MetaMath and MAmmoTH models on the other hand show the highest negative deviations from the trend suggesting overfitting.
   427: 
   428: %This also explains the previous observation that smaller models within the same family, observe larger drops (see Appendix~\ref{app:expts} for further discussion). We hypothesize that this relationship can be explained by the fact that the questions in the generated dataset consist of two skills at a time, as compared to questions in MATH, which consist of one skill.

The complexity of polynomial operations is on par with the given examples for the skill, involving factoring and simplification to a more manageable form.
  1151: \\\\
  1152: 4. **Clarity and Completeness:** The question is well-defined. It provides the formula for the sequence \(a_n\), clearly defines \(b_n\) as the product of the sequence's terms, and specifies the desired output (units digit of \(b_{2023}\)).

Mathematics can be a muse for generating new dance, as in the work of Merce Cunningham and John Cage.  Or, math and dance can be sources of mutual analogies and resonances that inform how one perceives and creates work in each separately, as described in Sophia Merow’s 2019 Notices article e \href{https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201902/rnoti-p247.pdf?trk=1802&cat=collection}{``Making dance, making math: parallels.''}  These are interesting, useful and valid as answers to the questions we started with.

Working with scholars and scientists has clarified the value of this training and ability not only for choreographers, but also with potential application across many disciplines.

>   10: We translate the input sample as a mix instruction to train \texttt{Math-LMM}. The template instruction is ``This is text. [IMAGE1]. This is text. ... This is text. [IMAGE2]. [IMAGE3] ... ", where [IMAGE] is the image embedding after alignment.
    11: First, we input the images into the vision encoder (e.g., ViT \cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/DosovitskiyB0WZ21}, DFN-5B-H-14+ \cite{fang2023data}) to obtain the image representation with a fixed dimension. The vision encoder is pre-trained on large-scale visual or multimodal datasets, which can embed the image effectively.
    12: Then, we obtain the image embedding [IMAGE] by aligning the image representation with LLM using an adapter. Common designs for the adapter include Cross-Attention \cite{gheini2021cross}, Q-Former \cite{li2023blip}, and MLP. We chose a simple but equally effective two-layer MLP with GELU functions for our Adapter.

    99: % Students often struggle with math word problems (MWPs) because they do not know how to approach the problem or where to begin. According to a survey by the EdWeek Research Center, roughly 50\% of students can read the problem but cannot understand the mathematical question being asked. Even when they grasp the math concepts involved, they may find it difficult to identify key information and choose the appropriate mathematical operation to solve the problem. Schema-based instruction (SBI) is a well-established, evidence-based strategy that helps students categorize word problems based on their underlying structure or schema, enabling them to better identify relevant information and apply the correct mathematical operations.Building on this foundation, we propose a Schema-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, incorporating a large language model (LLM). Our approach not only focuses on the correctness of solving the problem but also emphasizes step-by-step reasoning by identifying the underlying structure and generating detailed solutions. We evaluate the performance of our approach from an educational perspective on the GSM8K dataset by comparing it against responses generated by other large language models, including GPT-4 and GPT -3.5. We introduce a new method called the "reasoning score" metric to assess the quality of solutions and employ an LLM-as-a-Judge method to evaluate the generated responses. Our findings suggest that schema-based RAG improves problem-solving accuracy and reasoning clarity, offering educational benefits and providing a robust solution to the challenges students face in MWPs.

However, in event data, we cannot afford to lose spatial and temporal information.

We up-sample the different EPs classes up to a minimum $\theta_1 = 6000 $ and downsample the most popular ones down to a maximum $\theta_2 = 12000$.

   550: and applied a mixed feed-forward network (\textit{mixffn}) \cite{NEURIPS2021_64f1f27b} to the mileage embedding. The \textit{time} model refers to $\mathbf{T}$ which is also added to $\mathbf{E}$. Finally, we trained a model with and without the \textit{Random Event Head}. 
   551: Our experiments revealed several key insights:
>  552: By applying a \textit{cross} attention, we can see improvement in all metrics (\textit{rotnocross-ce-1-2}), which is consistent with the machine translation analogy \textit{"dtc2errorpattern"}. The best cross attention results were shown with $H(S)$ used as \textit{key-value}. Adding the mileage via an MLP layer (\textit{cross-mixffn}) seemed to help the MAPE (-2.5\%), the $\text{CPMWAUC}_{\text{f1}}(+9)$ and also the $\text{CPMWAUC}_\text{mae}(-0.005)$ compared to \textit{time-cross-query} model, suggesting that mileage is beneficial for both task. This makes sense since EPs are also dependent on the traveled distances between DTCs and the different stationary behavior of the vehicle. Furthermore, models incorporating a RoPE (\textit{rot}) performed significantly better in both regression and classification tasks like in the pre-training, highlighting the performance of RoPE in machine translation tasks \cite{Roformer}. Adding $\mathbf{CE}$ to the last layer (\textit{ce-2}) gave the best results, as opposed to adding it to both layers (\textit{ce-1-2}). Surprisingly, doing feature engineering on $\mathbf{T}, \mathbf{M}$ with a \textit{speed} matrix $\mathbf{S}_\text{rel}$ didn't help the metrics, which could indicate some missing modalities (e.g. mileage) during training, thus $\mathbf{CE}$ is more adapted for real-world scenarios. We monitored the need for our \textit{Random Event Head} in Figure \ref{fig:randomhead} (Appendix \ref{appendix:cpmwauc}) and noticed $+1.2\%$ in the F1 Score and $+10.1$ in the $\text{CPMW}_{f1}$.
   553: When taking the best performing model (\textit{rotcross-key-value-scaled-ce-2}), the model entered the CPMW after 81 observations i.e. \textbf{half of the sequence}. Within this window, the model obtained an error of $\mathbf{\approx 65 \pm 14}$\textbf{h} when estimating the time of EP occurrence (Figure \ref{fig:mae_h}), highlighting the model's predictive capability within the CPMW. Otherwise, the average absolute error across all observations was approximately $58.4 \pm 13.2$h. 
   554: By experimenting with these modifications, we aimed to identify the optimal architecture for predictive maintenance. The findings reveal that cross attention, context embedding in the second layer, and scaled attention significantly improve performance within the CPMW.

   550: and applied a mixed feed-forward network (\textit{mixffn}) \cite{NEURIPS2021_64f1f27b} to the mileage embedding. The \textit{time} model refers to $\mathbf{T}$ which is also added to $\mathbf{E}$. Finally, we trained a model with and without the \textit{Random Event Head}. 
   551: Our experiments revealed several key insights:
>  552: By applying a \textit{cross} attention, we can see improvement in all metrics (\textit{rotnocross-ce-1-2}), which is consistent with the machine translation analogy \textit{"dtc2errorpattern"}. The best cross attention results were shown with $H(S)$ used as \textit{key-value}. Adding the mileage via an MLP layer (\textit{cross-mixffn}) seemed to help the MAPE (-2.5\%), the $\text{CPMWAUC}_{\text{f1}}(+9)$ and also the $\text{CPMWAUC}_\text{mae}(-0.005)$ compared to \textit{time-cross-query} model, suggesting that mileage is beneficial for both task. This makes sense since EPs are also dependent on the traveled distances between DTCs and the different stationary behavior of the vehicle. Furthermore, models incorporating a RoPE (\textit{rot}) performed significantly better in both regression and classification tasks like in the pre-training, highlighting the performance of RoPE in machine translation tasks \cite{Roformer}. Adding $\mathbf{CE}$ to the last layer (\textit{ce-2}) gave the best results, as opposed to adding it to both layers (\textit{ce-1-2}). Surprisingly, doing feature engineering on $\mathbf{T}, \mathbf{M}$ with a \textit{speed} matrix $\mathbf{S}_\text{rel}$ didn't help the metrics, which could indicate some missing modalities (e.g. mileage) during training, thus $\mathbf{CE}$ is more adapted for real-world scenarios.

Also avoided should be the  ambiguous  notation, $\sinh^{-1} x$. The correct notation is  $\arsinh x$. This has to do with the area, and not the arcs.

   144: \noindent \textbf{Different Question Types.} We compare the performance of various models on three types of questions. As shown in~\Cref{fig: lidar}(right), the accuracy of the model on multiple-choice questions is significantly higher than on free-form questions. We design two evaluation metrics for multi-step questions: Step Accuracy Rate (\textbf{SAR}) and Question Completeness Rate (\textbf{QCR}). SAR refers to the proportion of correctly answered steps out of the total steps, while QCR is the proportion of questions for which all steps were answered correctly. The model with the best performance on the QCR metric is GPT-4o, achieving only 6\%, while its corresponding SAR is 32.6\%. This reflects the model's insufficient ability to perform complex reasoning on open and multi-step questions, and also reveals that the multiple-choice question format may not truly reflect the model's actual reasoning and problem-solving ability, as they usually rely on prompts to identify options.
   145: 
>  146: \noindent \textbf{Different Difficulty Levels.} ~\Cref{tab:result_diffculty} compares the performance of selected models across three difficulty levels. GPT-4o demonstrates significantly higher proficiency with a success rate of 40.3\% in the "Easy" category. For the "Medium" category, Claude achieves the best performance at 37.5\%. The performance disparity further decreases in the "Hard" category, where the leading Claude model reaches only 26.6\% accuracy. As the difficulty level increases, the performance gap between models becomes smaller. Of particular note, Claude is the only model whose performance on medium difficulty exceeds that on low difficulty, whereas the performance of other models progressively declines as the difficulty level increases.

>  479: A primary challenge in real-world causal discovery is the long-tail distribution of outcome labels, where a few "head" labels possess abundant data while the vast majority of "tail" labels are data-sparse  \cite{longtailissue}. %This imbalance creates a difficult trade-off for any single, static aggregation threshold. For rare labels, where empirical edge frequencies are high-variance estimators, a conservative high threshold (e.g., majority voting with ) is necessary to maintain precision against statistical noise. Conversely, for common labels, where frequencies are reliable low-variance estimators, a high threshold would be overly stringent, purging weaker but valid causal links and unnecessarily reducing recall.
   480: %This imbalance in sample counts is reminiscent of term-frequency skew in information retrieval. Classical weighting schemes like TF–IDF \cite{salton_termweighting_1988} balance local importance (TF) against global prevalence (IDF), but in our setting a naïve application can over-emphasize edges in rare Markov Boundaries (inflated TF) or misrepresent the effect of sparsity when sample sizes vary across labels.

We then consider the \$2n\$ angles \$\textbackslash{}angle A\_\{1\} A\_\{2\} A\_\{3\}\$, \$ \textbackslash{}angle A\_\{2\} A\_\{3\} A\_\{4\}, \textbackslash{}ldots, \textbackslash{}angle A\_\{2n-2\} A\_\{2n-1\} A\_\{2n\}, \textbackslash{}angle A\_\{2n-1\} A\_\{2n\} A\_\{1\}, \textbackslash{}angle A\_\{2n\} A\_\{1\} A\_\{2\}\$. We measure each angle in the way that gives the smallest positive value (i.e. between \$0\textasciicircum{}\{\textbackslash{}circ\}\$ and \$180\textasciicircum{}\{\textbackslash{}circ\}\$). Prove that there exists an ordering of the given points such that the resulting \$2n\$ angles can be separated into two groups with the sum of one group of angles equal to the sum of the other group. \\

Instead, we focus on pre-survey questions which participants answered assigning importance to different interestingness reasons (e.g., ``Please indicate how important this factor generally is for a problem to be interesting to you: The problem statement is simple and elegant.''). The answers were collected on a four point scale of "not important" to "very important" with an option to mark if the criterion did not make sense to the participant. We replicate this experiment with all LLMs we examine, sampling 50 responses (to match the 48 participants from our IMO study).

>  647: \paragraph{Elegance played a key role in human interestingness judgments of the IMO problems.} For the IMO survey, each participant rated the interestingness of four problems and selected interestingness/uninterestingness rationales for their rating. In Appendix Figure \ref{fig:hist_int_unint}, we include a histogram of the frequency of different rationales for interestingness/uninterestingness. The three most frequently marked reasons for interestingness were ``the problem statement is simple and elegant," ``the solution does not require any sophisticated techniques/theorems," and ``the solution is elegant." We also include a correlation matrix depicting when people chose multiple reasons for interestingness/uninterestingness for the same problem in Appendix Figure~\ref{fig:int_unint_corr}.
   648: 
   649: \paragraph{Reasons for interestingness across LLMs.} In Figure~\ref{fig:human_interestingness_importance}, we show histograms of human participants importance ratings for various interestingness criteria. Figures~\ref{fig:mistral_7b_interestingness_importance} through \ref{fig:r1_interestingness_importance} includes this for the LLMs we examine.

For each map, the axis labels are longitude (130 degrees west to 60 degrees west) and latitude (20 degrees north to 50 degrees north). The first column of plots is labeled "private use" and the second column "public use". The first row of plots is labeled "privately owned" and the second is labeled "publicly owned". Points are shown on each of the four plots, where each point represents an airport. There appear to be many thousands of points shown in the upper-left map (private use, privately owned) and the lower-right map (public use, publicly owned), while there are relatively fewer points -- even if still numbering in the hundreds or low thousands -- in the other two plots. In all plots, there is a greater density of points shown in the Middle and Eastern portions of the United States, with a more sparse number of points over the mountain and desert areas, and then a higher concentration of points again around the states bordered by the Pacific Ocean, especially near large cities.]{0.9}{eoce/airports}{airports}

The grid of plots has 2 rows and 3 columns, and the plots in this description will be referenced by number, where the numbering runs from 1 to 3 in the first row and 4 to 6 in the second row. For all plots, the horizontal axis is for "year" (about 1945 to about 2018) and the vertical axis is for "percent yes" with values ranging from 0\% to 100\%. Each of the six plots summarizes voting patterns in response to a different topic at the UN General Assembly and for the countries Canada (blue), Mexico (green), and the United States (red). Each plot has points and flexible (nonlinear) trend lines fit to those points. In all cases except Plot 2 for "Colonialism", the points (data) are relatively sparse in 1940 to 1960 relative to later years. Plot 1 represents "Arms control and disarmament", which for all countries starts out low, between 0\% and 25\%, and then quickly rises by 1960 to between 25\% to 95\%, where the US remains the lowest (hovering around 25\% to 40\%), Canada a bit higher between 50\% to 70\%, and Mexico the highest and typically between 85\% to 100\%. Plot 2 is labeled "Colonialism", and the trend lines start out between 50\% to 80\%, with the US then descending close to 0\% by 1980, while Canada fluctuates between 25\% to 60\% over the duration, and Mexico rises to close to 100\% by 1980. Plot 3 represents "Economic development", where the three countries al start near 25\% to 40\%, with the US declining to about 5\% by 1990 before rising up to 20\%, Canada descending to about 25\% by 1985 before rising to 50\% by 2000 before descending again to 25\%, and Mexico rising to about 100\% by 1980 before descending to about 85\%. Plot 4 represents "Human rights", with all countries being clustered near 65\% in 1945, then the US descends to 25\% by 1975 and fluctuates between 10\% and 30\% for the rest of the time, Canada slowly descends over time to about 15\%, and Mexico rises to close to 100\% by 1985 and then descends slowly to about 80\%. Plot 5 represents "Nuclear weapons and materials", with all countries starting near 0\% in 1945, with the US then rising a bit but generally fluctuating between 15\% to 40\%, Canada rising to about 60\% by 1965 before descending to and fluctuating around 40\% to 50\%, and Mexico rising rapidly to about 90\% by 1970 then approaching 100\% over time. Plot 6 represents the "Palestinian conflict", where the countries all start between 50\% to 75\%, with the US declining steadily to about 10\% by 1985 and then approaching 5\% after that, Canada declines a bit to about 35\% in 1970 before rising to about 70\% in 2000 and then descending rapidly to close to 0\%, and Mexico gradually increases to about 95\% in 1985 and then holds roughly steady.]{0.9}{eoce/unvotes}{unvotes}

Each of these branches has secondary branches with conditional probabilities for "Positive" and "Negative" mammogram outcomes conditional on whether the truth is having cancer or not. The Cancer primary branch breaks into branches for "Positive", with a conditional probability of 0.89 with a Cancer-and-Positive final probability of 0.00312, and a "Negative" secondary branch, with a conditional probability of 0.11 with a Cancer-and-Negative final probability of 0.00038.

It starts flat near 0, and curves upwards reaching a maximum slope as it crosses logit of 0 and a proportion of 0.5, at which point the slope starts tapering off again and flattening out as it approaches a value of 1. The following points are annotated on the curve, where the first value of each pair is for the logit value and the second is for the corresponding probability: (-5, 0.007), (-4, 0.018), (-3, 0.05), (-2, 0.12), (-1, 0.27), (0, 0.5), (1, 0.73), (2, 0.88), (3, 0.95), (4, 0.982), (5, 0.993), (6, 0.998).]

The left bar plot has Homeownership on the horizontal axis and Frequency (count) on the Vertical axis. Each level of homeownership has its own "bar" (which looks like a tall rectangle resting on the horizontal axis) with a height corresponding the frequency of that bar in the data set. For example, the "Rent" bar extends from the horizontal axis up to a frequency of about 3900. The "Mortgage" bar extends from the horizontal axis up to about 4700, and the bar for "Own" extends up to at about 1300.

The left bar plot has Homeownership on the horizontal axis and Frequency (count) on the Vertical axis. Each level of homeownership has its own "bar" (which looks like a tall rectangle resting on the horizontal axis) with a height corresponding the frequency of that bar in the data set. For example, the "Rent" bar extends from the horizontal axis up to a frequency of about 3900. The "Mortgage" bar extends from the horizontal axis up to about 4700, and the bar for "Own" extends up to at about 1300.

The first of these two bars is blue for "individual" application type (having a height of about 3500) and the second is yellow for the "joint" application type (having a height of about 400). After this first group of two bars, there is a small horizontal gap before the next pair of bars that represent the mortgage homeownership category. Here again, there is first a blue bar for individual application type, where this blue bar stretches up to a value of about 3900, and next to it is a yellow bar for the joint application type, which stretches up to about 800. After this second pair of bars, there is a little more space as we move right along the plot before we reach the "own" homeownership category, which shows another pair of bars: blue (with a bar reaching a frequency or count of about 1100) and yellow (with a bar reaching a value of about 200).]

> 1903:     \Figures[A two-variable mosaic plot is shown, partitioned with vertical slices first for the homeownership variable in the same way as a one-variable mosaic plot, and then each of the tall rectangle from that one-variable mosaic plot has been sliced horizontally to represent the application types individual (shown as the upper portion of each tall rectangle) and joint (shown as the lower portion of each tall rectangle). Taking the first tall rectangle on the left of the mosaic plot, which is green and labeled as "rent", it is divided into a small "joint" rectangle at the bottom of the "rent" rectangle and a much larger upper portion that represents the "individual" application types of the rent homeownership cases. This same partitioning is repeated for the tall middle rectangle representing the blue mortgage homeownership cases, where a small portion of those applications are broken off into a smaller rectangle on the bottom for "joint" and a larger rectangle for the cases that are "individual". Similarly, the rightmost tall rectangle that is red and represents "own" has been divided into a lower rectangle for "joint" and an upper portion for "individual" application types. The benefit of this plot is that we can now get a sense of the proportional makeup of each homeownership category by looking at the relative widths of the three different colored tall rectangles, and we can also look at where each of these tall rectangles is broken into joint and individual applications. In this case, the tall rectangle for rent is broken lower than the mortgage and own levels, indicating it has fewer of the "joint" application types (which if you recall, was the lower sub-divided rectangles). The "own" category also has its horizontal break a bit lower than the "mortgage" rectangle's break, implying the mortgage category has the highest proportion of joint applications of the rent, mortgage, and own homeownership categories.]

Taking the first tall rectangle on the left of the mosaic plot, which is green and labeled as "rent", it is divided into a small "joint" rectangle at the bottom of the "rent" rectangle and a much larger upper portion that represents the "individual" application types of the rent homeownership cases. This same partitioning is repeated for the tall middle rectangle representing the blue mortgage homeownership cases, where a small portion of those applications are broken off into a smaller rectangle on the bottom for "joint" and a larger rectangle for the cases that are "individual". Similarly, the rightmost tall rectangle that is red and represents "own" has been divided into a lower rectangle for "joint" and an upper portion for "individual" application types. The benefit of this plot is that we can now get a sense of the proportional makeup of each homeownership category by looking at the relative widths of the three different colored tall rectangles, and we can also look at where each of these tall rectangles is broken into joint and individual applications. In this case, the tall rectangle for rent is broken lower than the mortgage and own levels, indicating it has fewer of the "joint" application types (which if you recall, was the lower sub-divided rectangles). The "own" category also has its horizontal break a bit lower than the "mortgage" rectangle's break, implying the mortgage category has the highest proportion of joint applications of the rent, mortgage, and own homeownership categories.]

> 2090:   \Figure[There are two figures shown: a side-by-side box plot on the left, and a two overlaid hollow histograms on the right. These two plots describe the same data for the "county" data set: a numerical variable for median household income and a categorical variable with levels of "gain" and "no gain" for the population change in the county. First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000. Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

These two plots describe the same data for the "county" data set: a numerical variable for median household income and a categorical variable with levels of "gain" and "no gain" for the population change in the county. First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000. Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000.

The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

> 2090:   \Figure[There are two figures shown: a side-by-side box plot on the left, and a two overlaid hollow histograms on the right. These two plots describe the same data for the "county" data set: a numerical variable for median household income and a categorical variable with levels of "gain" and "no gain" for the population change in the county. First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000. Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked.

> 2090:   \Figure[There are two figures shown: a side-by-side box plot on the left, and a two overlaid hollow histograms on the right. These two plots describe the same data for the "county" data set: a numerical variable for median household income and a categorical variable with levels of "gain" and "no gain" for the population change in the county. First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000. Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000.

> 2090:   \Figure[There are two figures shown: a side-by-side box plot on the left, and a two overlaid hollow histograms on the right. These two plots describe the same data for the "county" data set: a numerical variable for median household income and a categorical variable with levels of "gain" and "no gain" for the population change in the county. First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000. Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box".

In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

> 2090:   \Figure[There are two figures shown: a side-by-side box plot on the left, and a two overlaid hollow histograms on the right. These two plots describe the same data for the "county" data set: a numerical variable for median household income and a categorical variable with levels of "gain" and "no gain" for the population change in the county. First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000. Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories.

It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

> 2090:   \Figure[There are two figures shown: a side-by-side box plot on the left, and a two overlaid hollow histograms on the right. These two plots describe the same data for the "county" data set: a numerical variable for median household income and a categorical variable with levels of "gain" and "no gain" for the population change in the county. First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000. Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked.
