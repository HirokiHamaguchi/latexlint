In the course of analyzing video of upper-division students solving problems {\it in situ}, we noticed that they shift between sense-making activities and activities whose sole purpose appears to be ``doing math.'' We are interested in investigating: how do students collectively set up the problem and determine that they are ready to "just do math"? how (if at all) do students reflect upon and interpret the result they get from doing the math?  To answer these questions we need to be able to reliably identify when students are ``just doing math." To this end, we have conducted a preliminary study where we leveraged the epistemic frame construct \cite{Scherr:2009gm,Irving:2013bi}. We have identified markers in students' behaviors and discourse that are indicative of students "just doing math."

>  193: \section{The visitors' impressions} \label{sec4} Multimedia installations and interwoven threads were not the only factors of success for the first set-up of the exhibition \textit{MadeInMath}. The animators were of crucial importance because they were mediators between organizers and visitors. Master students in various degrees in science (Mathematics, Biology, Physics, etc.) have been trained on the topics covered by the exhibition to accompany the many school-groups, but also to follow individual visitors, or small groups of hesitant visitors. For animators it was undoubtedly a formative moment for their training and their personal growth. Each of them, in fact, was free to propose their reading of the contents of the exhibition because the exhibition has various interpretations and visits had different cuts. People reported that they visited it twice and had different impressions each time. The ability to create connections between seemingly unrelated issues is one of the most powerful activity of mathematics, which gave the show an edge. It was thanks to all these facets that each visitor could grasp interesting aspects depending on their age, their training and their own interests. As commented in \cite{tg} by one of the animators, Maurizio Giaffredo, each of us animators took away a wealth of meetings and reflections whose value derives from the diversity of people and ideas that we had the chance to meet. In just two weeks the exhibition was visited by over 40,000 visitors. Of these, about 18,000 were students, mostly from middle and  high school. This means that more than half of the visitors fall into the category `general public`, which was quite a success. Beyond the figures, it was impressive to experience a high level of satisfaction by visitors. An initial indicator in this regard was to see students on a visit with the class during the week and then see them again at the weekend with their parents or other friends to illustrate some of the content of the exhibition as if they were young guides. A second indicator comes from the evidence left by visitors. Let us quote some of the thousands that people delighted in leaving. One of them says: "We knew the beauty of mathematics, but we did not suspect that  it was so beautiful. Thank you also for the love and attention to the teacher's figure". In fact, part of the exhibition gave space to the admirable work done every day by teachers, in this case those of mathematics. We were particularly pleased that this aspect has been apprehended and appreciated. Further evidence comes from some foreign visitors, who wrote: "I wish I had paid more attention to math class!" indicating the fact that the exhibition has managed to somehow overcome the misconception regarding mathematics and bring in the foreground some of the fundamental aspects of the teaching of mathematics (but not only), such as curiosity, wonder and the transmission of important ideas and not only tedious techniques. In this regard, a visitor wrote that he/she discovered a new world. In this sense, the initial disorientation was overcome in an unexpected and positive way because the exhibition succeeded in unveiling the potential of mathematics, which previously seemed unattainable. Another witness is grateful for the many ideas and so many hints that would be used at school for events on the subject of mathematics. There have also been some criticism, sometimes because of the difficulty in understanding certain topics. For this, as we discussed before, the guides were really fundamental because they played a role as a cultural mediator. The comments regarding some guides have been very positive, as, for example, "The exhibition is very beautiful but the enthusiasm of our guide was exceptional". Finally, we would like to quote a comment by a visitor, probably very young, that after the visit wrote that the exhibition was better than \textit {Gardaland} (an amusement park)!

An initial indicator in this regard was to see students on a visit with the class during the week and then see them again at the weekend with their parents or other friends to illustrate some of the content of the exhibition as if they were young guides. A second indicator comes from the evidence left by visitors. Let us quote some of the thousands that people delighted in leaving. One of them says: "We knew the beauty of mathematics, but we did not suspect that  it was so beautiful. Thank you also for the love and attention to the teacher's figure". In fact, part of the exhibition gave space to the admirable work done every day by teachers, in this case those of mathematics. We were particularly pleased that this aspect has been apprehended and appreciated. Further evidence comes from some foreign visitors, who wrote: "I wish I had paid more attention to math class!" indicating the fact that the exhibition has managed to somehow overcome the misconception regarding mathematics and bring in the foreground some of the fundamental aspects of the teaching of mathematics (but not only), such as curiosity, wonder and the transmission of important ideas and not only tedious techniques. In this regard, a visitor wrote that he/she discovered a new world. In this sense, the initial disorientation was overcome in an unexpected and positive way because the exhibition succeeded in unveiling the potential of mathematics, which previously seemed unattainable. Another witness is grateful for the many ideas and so many hints that would be used at school for events on the subject of mathematics. There have also been some criticism, sometimes because of the difficulty in understanding certain topics. For this, as we discussed before, the guides were really fundamental because they played a role as a cultural mediator. The comments regarding some guides have been very positive, as, for example, "The exhibition is very beautiful but the enthusiasm of our guide was exceptional". Finally, we would like to quote a comment by a visitor, probably very young, that after the visit wrote that the exhibition was better than \textit {Gardaland} (an amusement park)!

>  193: \section{The visitors' impressions} \label{sec4} Multimedia installations and interwoven threads were not the only factors of success for the first set-up of the exhibition \textit{MadeInMath}. The animators were of crucial importance because they were mediators between organizers and visitors. Master students in various degrees in science (Mathematics, Biology, Physics, etc.) have been trained on the topics covered by the exhibition to accompany the many school-groups, but also to follow individual visitors, or small groups of hesitant visitors. For animators it was undoubtedly a formative moment for their training and their personal growth. Each of them, in fact, was free to propose their reading of the contents of the exhibition because the exhibition has various interpretations and visits had different cuts. People reported that they visited it twice and had different impressions each time. The ability to create connections between seemingly unrelated issues is one of the most powerful activity of mathematics, which gave the show an edge. It was thanks to all these facets that each visitor could grasp interesting aspects depending on their age, their training and their own interests. As commented in \cite{tg} by one of the animators, Maurizio Giaffredo, each of us animators took away a wealth of meetings and reflections whose value derives from the diversity of people and ideas that we had the chance to meet. In just two weeks the exhibition was visited by over 40,000 visitors. Of these, about 18,000 were students, mostly from middle and  high school. This means that more than half of the visitors fall into the category `general public`, which was quite a success. Beyond the figures, it was impressive to experience a high level of satisfaction by visitors. An initial indicator in this regard was to see students on a visit with the class during the week and then see them again at the weekend with their parents or other friends to illustrate some of the content of the exhibition as if they were young guides.

>  103: It is highly probable that tweaked statements such as ``incorrect for mathematical solution" and "valid from physical point of view" could divert the scientific community further from the ground reality, which, on the contrary is not very difficult to fathom in the current context! If a partial differential equation modelling a physical system produces a mathematically correct solution having no physical relevance, it is a clear indication that the equation has failed to  model the physical system correctly. Viscous effects on the wall, which is a pre-requisite for flow separation leading to the formation of vortex is completely absent in equation \eqref{bi}.  We have also reiterated in our original work \cite{kal18} that one of the sources of this non-physical result is the discontinuity of the boundary conditions at $r=0$, ie., at the corner and  failure of equation \eqref{bi} in adhering to the continuum hypothesis on which the foundation of Navier-Stokes equation is built upon. R. L. Panton, in his highly acclaimed book {\bf Incompressible flows} \cite{pan} concurs with our views: citing a specific case of Stokes flow in corners, he states that the remedy of removing this discontinuity lies in solving another problem that allows for a small gap at the corner (the junction of the walls). If the gap is actually smaller than the continuum length scale, then there is a failure of the continuum hypothesis in this boundary condition.

>  105: Shtern \cite{sh18} further claims that ``the solution by Dean and Montagnon \cite{dean}, which was interpreted by Moffatt \cite{moff2}, is not analytical at the corners, therefore the theorems on a finite number of critical points in bounded domain by Kalita {\it et al.} \cite{kal18} are not applicable to the corner problem". This is a completely vague, out of the context and misleading statement, and there is no connection between the notion of infiniteness/ finiteness and a solution being analytic at the corner. Most of the books on elementary differential equations \cite{sne,john,zan,chil} would reveal that a boundary value problem (BVP) in a bounded domain contains two separate set of equations, one valid at the interior requiring it to be analytic or regular, and the other set of equations being prescribed at the boundaries. Equation \eqref{bi} or for that matter the equations under scrutiny in \cite{kal18,bakker,delery,ghil,hir,wang,wu}  are no different from them.

   107: The differential equations in the context of the current discussion pertain to a closed physical domain bounded by solid walls. Analyticity of the solution at the boundaries of such bounded domains (which invariably includes the corner) is not guaranteed because the derivative of a function is not defined at the boundaries. Owing to this, analytic functions are always defined on an open set. 
>  108: For the benefit of the readers, we offer a few lines from the book {\bf Complex variables and applications} by Brown and Churchill \cite{bro} on the definition of an analytic function: "A function $f$ of the complex variable $z$ is analytic in an open set if it has derivative at each point in that set. If we should speak of a function $f$ that is analytic in a set $S$ which is not open, it is to be understood that $f$ is anlytic in an open set containing $S$. In particular, $f$ is {\it analytic at a point $z_0$} if it is analytic in a neighbourhood of $z_0$." Opting to go for a complex function above arises out of the fact that the solution of \eqref{bi} in \cite{sh18,dean,moff2} is in the form of a complex variable.

>  112: The very definition of vortex requires \cite{hal} the rotational effect in the immediate neighbourhood of the vortex center. As such the circulation \cite{white,batch} of the vortex must be non zero. On the other hand, a vortex with zero length scale will naturally render a zero circulation for a vortex and hence would fail to satisfy the definition of a vortex. Therefore the smallest length scale that can be accommodated in the so called infinite sequence of vortices must be non-zero, even if smaller than the Kolomogorov length scale. This scale was used in the main proofs on finiteness in \cite{kal18} to signify a non zero length scale only. Any such length scale (referred to as $\eta$ in \cite{kal18}, page 10-11), be it Kolmogorov or anything else, is sufficient to ensure the finiteness.  Thus the claim by the author of reference \cite{sh18} that the notion of finiteness ``is not even heuristically valid if there are geometric length scales which are smaller than the Kolmogorov scale" is an invalid one.

>  114: The above brings us to another point raised in \cite{sh18}, that the authors (of \cite{kal18}) had not offered or referred to any proof of the statement ``A vortex scale cannot be smaller than Kolmogorov length scale". A close examination of \cite{kal18} would reveal that no such statement was made thereat; rather it was stated that ``the Kolmogorov theory \cite{wal} asserts that eddies below a certain size cannot be formed." However, Shtern \cite{sh18} avoids making any comments on the justification provided in the last paragrpah of section 2.3.1  pertaining to Kolmogorov length scale in \cite{kal18}. Under the same geometric configuration, for a flow undergoing laminar to turbulent transition, can the smallest possible laminar scale  be smaller than the smallest turbulent scale defined by the Kolmogorov scale? The answer is a clear no, which comes from experimental and numerical evidences. For example, the visualization of flow past bluff bodies at high Reynolds numbers, where the flow is laminar just behind the body initially and becomes turbulent in the downstream region away from the body  later on (see the visualizations  in \cite{dyke,zad1,zad2}, Chapter 7 of \cite{white} Chapters 5, 6 of \cite{white1}). Another example in this context is the visualization of flows arising out of plane jets at different Reylonds numbers depicting the laminar and turbulent  regimes \cite{sur,tenn}. Just behind the jets, the turbulent length scales are much smaller than the laminar ones here. Recall that the concept of the Kolmogorov length scale comes from the cascading effect where energy is transferred from larger to smaller eddies. Laminar eddies are not small enough to accommodate the mixing of the eddies to facilitate the transfer of energy \cite{white1}.

>    3: According to Mathematician Polya's famous problem solving heuristics, asking general common sense questions about the problem  facilitates problem understanding. One such question is  ``What is the unknown?"~\cite{george1957solve}.  The unknown of a given problem is what the problem requires  to be worked out and solved.  In this paper, we propose computational models for extracting the unknown from  problem specifications.

   166: \section{Conclusions and Future Work}
>  167: Our new task, dataset, and  results are  only initial steps, and  pave the way for  future work. Beyond  ``what is the unknown?", we can  develop  models that ask other general common sense questions that can support the problem solving process. \citet{george1957solve}  presents a list of  more such questions. These questions are general,  future work includes working on problems from  topics other than Probability. Additionally,  future work can study who this line of work can benefit from well-studied aspects of   knowledge harvesting and representation~\cite{DBLP:conf/webdb/NakasholeTW10,theobald2010urdf,DBLP:conf/vlds/NakasholeSST12, nakashole2012automatic,kumar2017discovering}.

>  107: Teachers frequently create customized content to align better with their curriculum and teaching objectives, building upon existing materials. \textit{"I would often just use specific images or drawings from textbooks and papers to explain a concept"} (E4). Our AR approach offers significant support in this area. During the interviews, instructors appreciated the system's ability to select from various augmentation techniques, enabling them to customize the augmented textbook according to their specific needs. This adaptability allows them to tailor the content to their course's learning objectives and their students' requirements. One expert (E1) found that integrating interactive websites into teaching can be challenging due to unfamiliarity with the site's functionalities or difficulties inputting functions into the system. Furthermore, comprehending the website's content and relating it back to the course material can also be challenging (E2). In contrast, our AR approach offers instructors more control over the material they are presenting (E1, E4). This control is particularly beneficial when teaching in front of a class, as customizing the material to suit specific teaching objectives is more desirable than using pre-animated content, such as videos (E1).
   108: Overall, our AR approach delivers an efficient and adaptable solution for instructors to create interactive materials that align with their teaching objectives and better engage their students.

Further research extends the reasoning capabilities of CoT by applying majority voting to improve self-consistency~\citep{wang2023selfconsistency}, choosing few-shot examples and output chains with more complex reasoning steps~\citep{fu2022complexity}, breaking down the problem to simpler sub-problems~\citep{zhou2023leasttomost}, or even expanding Chain-of-thought to Tree-of-Thoughts~\citep{Yao2023TreeOT}. Similar to Zero-shot-CoT, our method apply  “step by step"-like prompts to regularize \gptcode's use of code without the careful design of step-by-step few-shot examples. Additionally, We enhance majority voting to verification-guided weighted majority voting, leveraging the results of CSV as voting weights.

>  193: We prompt ChatGPT to generate QA pairs from \topicmath{} for our evaluation purposes. Our inference strategy involves using prompts that promote diversification in tokens, topic alignment, and difficulty. The algorithm is presented in Algorithm~\ref{alg:answer-unaware-qa-generation}. Specifically, we create a list of generated QA pairs for each lesson in \topicmath. Given a lesson, our prompt consists of its definition and the topic's name it belongs to, and one demonstration randomly selected from its list of generated QA pairs. After getting the newly generated QA pair, we accept it if its question has a ROUGE-L score less than $0.7$ with any of all the questions generated from all the lessons, otherwise, we filter it out. To promote token diversity in generating educational questions, we utilize two strategies.  For grades 1-8, we ask ChatGPT to enrich the generated questions by providing objects and stories via adding \texttt{"You could introduce characters, objects
   194: or scenarios to make your math problem context more diverse in terms of token"} to the prompts. For tertiary classes, the problems might be complicated and require more rigorous and abstract thinking. Therefore, instead of requiring a real-life context, we instruct the model to introduce more variables in naming the objects via supplementing \texttt{"Your questions are required to be diverse in terms of tokens, which can be achieved by paraphrasing the question or introducing/renaming variables"} to the prompts, so the abstract contexts could be generalized. We name our generated dataset from ChatGPT for evaluations as {\dataset}, consisting of $16K$ QA pairs. Our prompt template is below.

>  105: In \textit{Reacting to Errors}, a tutor is required to respond to a student’s mistake in solving a math problem according to specified elements of appropriate responses as highlighted in research \citep{lepper2002wisdom, loewenberg2009work}.  These elements encompass praising the attempt or effort; subtly drawing attention to the mistake, and guiding the student toward self-correction \citep{lepper2002wisdom}. Any response that explicitly points out the student’s error, instructs the student on what exactly to do, or simply provides the correct answer is not desirable \citep{lepper1993motivational}. To assess a tutor’s response, we establish five criteria in line with the research-recommended approach. The tutor’s response should be: 1) process- or effort-focused, acknowledging the student’s effort; 2) motivating, avoiding negative language and encouraging the student to recognize the mistake on their own; 3) indirect in addressing the error, using leading questions without negative connotations, such as using words like “mistake” or “error” that may discourage the student; 4) immediate, remaining relevant to the problem at hand; and 5) sincere and accurate, such as ensuring truthful praise to the situation (e.g., praising a student for working hard only when they actually put forth effort) and being mathematically correct. Research suggests that students with high and low self-efficacy measures benefit differently from tutorial dialogue \citep{wiggins2017you}. Low-efficacy students may benefit more from an indirect and more subtle approach when reacting to errors than high-efficacy students, who may not be bothered by tutors calling direct attention to their mistakes. The proposed tutoring strategy is recommended for low-efficacy students, or students who historically struggle in math indicated by a history of low performance and proficiency.

>  151: \textbf{Large language models demonstrate proficiency in identifying criteria on how to best respond to students making an error, however, both models exhibit limitations in recognizing if an error was made.} In responding to RQ1 on the ability of LLMs to effectively identify criteria for tutors reacting to students making errors, both GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 performed fairly well. Table 2 displays the absolute performance of both models in assessing the criteria. GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 both did particularly well on the criteria of \textit{immediate} and \textit{accurate}, with F1 scores equal to or greater than 0.80 for both these criteria. We posit that these models were able to achieve high levels of accuracy in identifying these criteria as \textit{immediate} was quite straightforward to recognize. The tutor typically discussed situations relevant to the problem, and the \textit{accurate} criteria could be graded by simply ensuring well-established mathematical principles were followed. For the \textit{process-focused} and \textit{indirect} criteria, both models struggled a bit more, as shown by lower F1 scores relative to the rest of the criteria. We believe the models interpreted \textit{indirect} feedback to a student making an error as primarily focused on not giving away the correct response, allowing the terms “mistake” and “error” (e.g., a tutor saying,\textit{“You’re close, but there may be a small error”}), which are phrases our human graders found as discouraging in a tutoring session. The annotation guide for human graders (Appendix C) states, “The tutor avoids the use of words such as \textit{mistake} or \textit{error}.” However, the few-shot LLM prompt does not explicitly state tutors should avoid such terms and only provides examples of met criteria, such as “\textit{You have the right idea}” and “\textit{Explain to me what you did here.}”

>  765: In this case, the model lists $9$ and $27$ as an even number, which leads to a false $(m,n)$ pair $(9,27)$. Moreover, the pairs $(6,54),(18,18)$, though satisfying the condition given by model prediction, do not meet the title requirements. The prediction just accidentally lists four pairs as answers. However, if the evaluation takes only the outcome into consideration, this sample will be "correct". 
   766: Similar cases appear more frequently as the difficulty level increases. Among these false positive cases, most problems have an integer as the answer, especially a single-digit number, and the solution can be carried out without detailed calculations or proof of cases. These make it easy for the model to speculate a correct answer excluding step-by-step reasoning. Simply judging model abilities only by outcome accuracy may be unilateral. Therefore, one of our future works is to use reward models or LEAN to provide a better process checking.

>  432: While minor deviations from $Y = X^2$ maybe attributed to noise and factors such as non-similar distribution of skills in MATH and MATH$^2$, it is noteworthy that three out of five of the recent ``thinking" models, namely o1-preview, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B show non-trivial positive deviations from this trend. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B shows the highest positive deviation of all models ($\sim10.5\%$ higher than what would be predicted by the trend). This suggests that the pre-dominantly RL-based post-training used in these models elicits more powerful reasoning and generalization capabilities. Claude-3.5 Sonnet and the MetaMath and MAmmoTH models on the other hand show the highest negative deviations from the trend suggesting overfitting.

> 2045: While minor deviations from $Y = X^2$ maybe attributed to noise and factors such as non-similar distribution of skills in MATH and MATH$^2$, it is noteworthy that three out of five of the recent ``thinking" models, namely o1-preview, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B show non-trivial positive deviations from this trend. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B shows the highest positive deviation of all models ($\sim10.5\%$ higher than what would be predicted by the trend). This suggests that the pre-dominantly RL-based post-training used in these models elicits more powerful reasoning and generalization capabilities. Claude-3.5 Sonnet and the MetaMath and MAmmoTH models on the other hand show the highest negative deviations from the trend suggesting overfitting.

>  426: While minor deviations from $Y = X^2$ maybe attributed to noise and factors such as non-similar distribution of skills in MATH and MATH$^2$, it is noteworthy that three out of five of the recent ``thinking" models, namely o1-preview, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B show non-trivial positive deviations from this trend. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B shows the highest positive deviation of all models ($\sim10.5\%$ higher than what would be predicted by the trend). This suggests that the pre-dominantly RL-based post-training used in these models elicits more powerful reasoning and generalization capabilities. Claude-3.5 Sonnet and the MetaMath and MAmmoTH models on the other hand show the highest negative deviations from the trend suggesting overfitting.

> 1007: During the human verification process, the annotators were instructed to be on the look out for any errors in the questions and solutions generated by the models, and fix any lack of clarity, ambiguity, convoluted language, etc. in the generated questions which might confuse the model and reduce the “quality” of the questions. They were also instructed to look out for specific modifications which could make the questions more difficult. For further discussion on the human verification process, refer to Section~\ref{app:human_ann}. In Table~\ref{tab:ques_mod} we compare the performance of models on the questions which were modified against their performance on the questions which were not modified.

    71: We now share ideas and talk with each other regularly in the course of our professional lives. Both of us have vested interests in discovering the many connections and potentials for math and dance collaborations. For example, I (Wolfson) have collaborated with \href{https://www.math.uci.edu/~apantano/index.html}{Alessandra Pantano} (UC Irvine, Dept. of Math) and \href{https://drama.arts.uci.edu/faculty/tara-rodman}{Tara Rodman} (UC Irvine, Dept. of Drama) to design and implement \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MS7GujCzuUVl9C3I1UIyt8eYAITOs5Ni/view}{lessons for middle school students on symmetry and dance} through UCI's \href{https://sites.ps.uci.edu/mathceo/}{MathCEO} program.  I (Wilson) am currently advocating for the value of what I call “a choreographic way of seeing”: sharing the ``How'' of training the eye to perceive what is actually there.  Last winter, I co-taught  a \href{https://africana.sas.upenn.edu/node/7963}{graduate seminar} at the University of Pennsylvania with \href{https://anthropology.sas.upenn.edu/people/deborah-a-thomas}{Deborah Thomas} (UPenn, Dept. of Anthropology) on  kinesthetic anthropology, focusing on my particular understanding of Choreographic Time, Space and Movement.  Working with scholars and scientists has clarified the value of this training and ability not only for choreographers, but also with potential application across many disciplines.

For example, I (Wolfson) have collaborated with \href{https://www.math.uci.edu/~apantano/index.html}{Alessandra Pantano} (UC Irvine, Dept. of Math) and \href{https://drama.arts.uci.edu/faculty/tara-rodman}{Tara Rodman} (UC Irvine, Dept. of Drama) to design and implement \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MS7GujCzuUVl9C3I1UIyt8eYAITOs5Ni/view}{lessons for middle school students on symmetry and dance} through UCI's \href{https://sites.ps.uci.edu/mathceo/}{MathCEO} program.  I (Wilson) am currently advocating for the value of what I call “a choreographic way of seeing”: sharing the ``How'' of training the eye to perceive what is actually there.  Last winter, I co-taught  a \href{https://africana.sas.upenn.edu/node/7963}{graduate seminar} at the University of Pennsylvania with \href{https://anthropology.sas.upenn.edu/people/deborah-a-thomas}{Deborah Thomas} (UPenn, Dept. of Anthropology) on  kinesthetic anthropology, focusing on my particular understanding of Choreographic Time, Space and Movement.  Working with scholars and scientists has clarified the value of this training and ability not only for choreographers, but also with potential application across many disciplines.

The vision encoder is pre-trained on large-scale visual or multimodal datasets, which can embed the image effectively.

>  101: Many students struggle with math word problems (MWPs), often finding it difficult to identify key information and select the appropriate mathematical operations. Schema-based instruction (SBI) is an evidence-based strategy that helps students categorize problems based on their structure, improving problem-solving accuracy. Building on this, we propose a Schema-Based Instruction Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SBI-RAG) framework that incorporates a large language model (LLM). Our approach emphasizes step-by-step reasoning by leveraging schemas to guide solution generation. We evaluate its performance on the GSM8K dataset, comparing it with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, and introduce a "reasoning score" metric to assess solution quality. Our findings suggest that SBI-RAG enhances reasoning clarity and facilitates a more structured problem-solving process

   469: In our case, and in most real-world problems, EPs are highly imbalanced across our dataset, which is a considerably more challenging problem for our event prediction task, especially when the least occurring classes are the most important to detect \cite{multilabelpredictionfault}. In natural language processing, traditional up-sampling methods involve perturbation of $S$ by shuffling and replacement of tokens. However, in event data, we cannot afford to lose spatial and temporal information. Therefore, we inject random events $(u_i, m_i, t_i)$ with the same probability of $p=0.05$ as in Section \ref{sec:pretraining} and reuse the associated Algorithm \ref{alg:randomeventinjectionalgorithm}. We up-sample the different EPs classes up to a minimum $\theta_1 = 6000 $ and downsample the most popular ones down to a maximum $\theta_2 = 12000$. We drop also classes below 100 apparitions across the dataset.
>  470: We define a minimum context $c=30$  which acts as a “minimum history” of DTCs to retain. 
   471: %The values of $c$ as well as empirical studies on the influence of the history $H_t$ on the predictions are discussed in Section \ref{experiments}.

   469: In our case, and in most real-world problems, EPs are highly imbalanced across our dataset, which is a considerably more challenging problem for our event prediction task, especially when the least occurring classes are the most important to detect \cite{multilabelpredictionfault}. In natural language processing, traditional up-sampling methods involve perturbation of $S$ by shuffling and replacement of tokens. However, in event data, we cannot afford to lose spatial and temporal information. Therefore, we inject random events $(u_i, m_i, t_i)$ with the same probability of $p=0.05$ as in Section \ref{sec:pretraining} and reuse the associated Algorithm \ref{alg:randomeventinjectionalgorithm}. We up-sample the different EPs classes up to a minimum $\theta_1 = 6000 $ and downsample the most popular ones down to a maximum $\theta_2 = 12000$. We drop also classes below 100 apparitions across the dataset.
>  470: We define a minimum context $c=30$  which acts as a “minimum history” of DTCs to retain. 
   471: %The values of $c$ as well as empirical studies on the influence of the history $H_t$ on the predictions are discussed in Section \ref{experiments}.

>  545: We used the micro-F1 score \cite{articlemultilabel} to assess the performance of the multi-label classification. To better understand and enhance our model's predictive maintenance capabilities, we introduce the concept of \textit{Confident Predictive Maintenance Window (CPMW)} which represents the interval within which our model can make reliable predictive maintenance predictions (similar to the "prediction window" described in \cite{interactivefeature}).
   546: We quantify this with the \textit{CPMW Area Under Curve} (\textit{CPMWAUC}). The F1 score, MAE and MAPE have been calculated on average for all observations in Table \ref{tab:epredictor_overall}, and additionally for each history $H^i_t$ in Figure \ref{fig:epredictor} to understand how each model performs with different numbers of observations. To monitor the predictive maintenance capability of each model, the $\text{CPMWAUC}_{\text{f1}}$ and $\text{CPMWAUC}_{\text{mae}}$ were computed. The Appendix \ref{appendix:error_pattern} contains the models and metrics definition.

   551: Our experiments revealed several key insights:
>  552: By applying a \textit{cross} attention, we can see improvement in all metrics (\textit{rotnocross-ce-1-2}), which is consistent with the machine translation analogy \textit{"dtc2errorpattern"}. The best cross attention results were shown with $H(S)$ used as \textit{key-value}. Adding the mileage via an MLP layer (\textit{cross-mixffn}) seemed to help the MAPE (-2.5\%), the $\text{CPMWAUC}_{\text{f1}}(+9)$ and also the $\text{CPMWAUC}_\text{mae}(-0.005)$ compared to \textit{time-cross-query} model, suggesting that mileage is beneficial for both task. This makes sense since EPs are also dependent on the traveled distances between DTCs and the different stationary behavior of the vehicle. Furthermore, models incorporating a RoPE (\textit{rot}) performed significantly better in both regression and classification tasks like in the pre-training, highlighting the performance of RoPE in machine translation tasks \cite{Roformer}. Adding $\mathbf{CE}$ to the last layer (\textit{ce-2}) gave the best results, as opposed to adding it to both layers (\textit{ce-1-2}). Surprisingly, doing feature engineering on $\mathbf{T}, \mathbf{M}$ with a \textit{speed} matrix $\mathbf{S}_\text{rel}$ didn't help the metrics, which could indicate some missing modalities (e.g. mileage) during training, thus $\mathbf{CE}$ is more adapted for real-world scenarios. We monitored the need for our \textit{Random Event Head} in Figure \ref{fig:randomhead} (Appendix \ref{appendix:cpmwauc}) and noticed $+1.2\%$ in the F1 Score and $+10.1$ in the $\text{CPMW}_{f1}$.
   553: When taking the best performing model (\textit{rotcross-key-value-scaled-ce-2}), the model entered the CPMW after 81 observations i.e. \textbf{half of the sequence}. Within this window, the model obtained an error of $\mathbf{\approx 65 \pm 14}$\textbf{h} when estimating the time of EP occurrence (Figure \ref{fig:mae_h}), highlighting the model's predictive capability within the CPMW. Otherwise, the average absolute error across all observations was approximately $58.4 \pm 13.2$h.

"What are its key properties and characteristics?" is almost always a bad reformulation because it is ambiguous what the student should write inside of the `\boxed{}`. "Express your answer in centimeters." is a good answer format specification because it does NOT give away the answer but does specify a clear format.\\

Given a positive integer \$n\$, Alice and Bob play the following game.   In the first round, Alice takes \$n\$ pebbles and distributes them into the 60 boxes as she wishes. Each subsequent round consists of two steps:  \textbackslash{}begin\{enumerate\}  \textbackslash{}item[(a)] Bob chooses an integer \$k\$ with \$1 \textbackslash{}leqslant k \textbackslash{}leqslant 59\$ and splits the boxes into the two groups \$B\_\{1\}, \textbackslash{}ldots, B\_\{k\}\$ and \$B\_\{k+1\}, \textbackslash{}ldots, B\_\{60\}\$.  \textbackslash{}item[(b)] Alice picks one of these two groups, adds one pebble to each box in that group, and removes one pebble from each box in the other group.  \textbackslash{}end\{enumerate\}  Bob wins if, at the end of any round, some box contains no pebbles. Find the smallest \$n\$ such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning. \\

One day, all the roads are declared to be "one way" only. Alice has no information on the direction of the roads, but the King of Hearts has offered to help her. She is allowed to ask him a number of questions. For each question in turn, Alice chooses a pair of towns and the King of Hearts tells her the direction of the road connecting those two towns.   Alice wants to know whether there is at least one town in Wonderland with at most one outgoing road. Prove that she can always find out by asking at most \$4n\$ questions. \\

Given a set of reals \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$, and an element \$x \textbackslash{}in \textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$, we say that the scales of \$x\$ in \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$ are the values of \$D(x, y)\$ for \$y \textbackslash{}in \textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$ with \$x \textbackslash{}neq y\$.  Let \$k\$ be a given positive integer. Suppose that each member \$x\$ of \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$ has at most \$k\$ different scales in \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$ (note that these scales may depend on \$x\$ ).

    67: 2019 C7 & There are 60 empty boxes \$B\_\{1\}, \textbackslash{}ldots, B\_\{60\}\$ in a row on a table and an unlimited supply of pebbles. Given a positive integer \$n\$, Alice and Bob play the following game.   In the first round, Alice takes \$n\$ pebbles and distributes them into the 60 boxes as she wishes. Each subsequent round consists of two steps:  \textbackslash{}begin\{enumerate\}  \textbackslash{}item[(a)] Bob chooses an integer \$k\$ with \$1 \textbackslash{}leqslant k \textbackslash{}leqslant 59\$ and splits the boxes into the two groups \$B\_\{1\}, \textbackslash{}ldots, B\_\{k\}\$ and \$B\_\{k+1\}, \textbackslash{}ldots, B\_\{60\}\$.  \textbackslash{}item[(b)] Alice picks one of these two groups, adds one pebble to each box in that group, and removes one pebble from each box in the other group.  \textbackslash{}end\{enumerate\}  Bob wins if, at the end of any round, some box contains no pebbles. Find the smallest \$n\$ such that Alice can prevent Bob from winning. \\
>   68: 2019 C8 & Alice has a map of Wonderland, a country consisting of \$n \textbackslash{}geqslant 2\$ towns. For every pair of towns, there is a narrow road going from one town to the other. One day, all the roads are declared to be "one way" only. Alice has no information on the direction of the roads, but the King of Hearts has offered to help her. She is allowed to ask him a number of questions. For each question in turn, Alice chooses a pair of towns and the King of Hearts tells her the direction of the road connecting those two towns.   Alice wants to know whether there is at least one town in Wonderland with at most one outgoing road. Prove that she can always find out by asking at most \$4n\$ questions. \\
    69: 2019 C9 & For any two different real numbers \$x\$ and \$y\$, we define \$D(x, y)\$ to be the unique integer \$d\$ satisfying \$2\textasciicircum{}\{d\} \textbackslash{}leqslant|x-y|<2\textasciicircum{}\{d+1\}\$. Given a set of reals \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$, and an element \$x \textbackslash{}in \textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$, we say that the scales of \$x\$ in \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$ are the values of \$D(x, y)\$ for \$y \textbackslash{}in \textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$ with \$x \textbackslash{}neq y\$.  Let \$k\$ be a given positive integer. Suppose that each member \$x\$ of \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$ has at most \$k\$ different scales in \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$ (note that these scales may depend on \$x\$ ). What is the maximum possible size of \$\textbackslash{}mathcal\{F\}\$ ? \\

Instead, we focus on pre-survey questions which participants answered assigning importance to different interestingness reasons (e.g., ``Please indicate how important this factor generally is for a problem to be interesting to you: The problem statement is simple and elegant.''). The answers were collected on a four point scale of "not important" to "very important" with an option to mark if the criterion did not make sense to the participant. We replicate this experiment with all LLMs we examine, sampling 50 responses (to match the 48 participants from our IMO study). For each interestingness criterion, human participants' answers collectively spanned the allowed range of importance options. However, despite sampling each LLM 50 times at temperature 1.0, most LLMs only selected one to two importance scores for each reason. We include comparisons between the human and model distributions for all models we examine in Appendix~\ref{app:add_results_imo}.

> 1741:     \Figuress[A stacked bar plot with Homeownership on the horizontal axis and Frequency (count) on the Vertical axis, where "app\_type" is used to break each bar into two categories: "joint" application type and "individual" application type. The first bar is for "Rent" and extends up to about 3900 total for the two application types together. This "Rent" bar is also broken into two categories, blue for "individual" and yellow for "joint". The bottom portion of the bar, running up to about 3500, is blue to represent the "joint" applications where the application had a "rent" value for homeownership, and the rest (about vertical height representing about 400) of the bar is yellow to represent the "individual" applications. The second bar is for "Mortgage" at about 4700 total, the bottom 3900 of which are shown as blue for individual applications and the top of which is yellow for "joint" applications and appears to have a height of about 800. The third bar is for "Own" at about 1300, of which about 1100 is for the individual (blue) application type and about 200 of which is joint (yellow) application type. Again, each homeownership bar is broken into a lower (blue) and upper portion (yellow) portion to express the breakdown of a homeownership level into the application types, allowing us to express a breakdown along two categorical variables in a single plot.]

This same partitioning is repeated for the tall middle rectangle representing the blue mortgage homeownership cases, where a small portion of those applications are broken off into a smaller rectangle on the bottom for "joint" and a larger rectangle for the cases that are "individual". Similarly, the rightmost tall rectangle that is red and represents "own" has been divided into a lower rectangle for "joint" and an upper portion for "individual" application types. The benefit of this plot is that we can now get a sense of the proportional makeup of each homeownership category by looking at the relative widths of the three different colored tall rectangles, and we can also look at where each of these tall rectangles is broken into joint and individual applications. In this case, the tall rectangle for rent is broken lower than the mortgage and own levels, indicating it has fewer of the "joint" application types (which if you recall, was the lower sub-divided rectangles). The "own" category also has its horizontal break a bit lower than the "mortgage" rectangle's break, implying the mortgage category has the highest proportion of joint applications of the rent, mortgage, and own homeownership categories.]

This same partitioning is repeated for the tall middle rectangle representing the blue mortgage homeownership cases, where a small portion of those applications are broken off into a smaller rectangle on the bottom for "joint" and a larger rectangle for the cases that are "individual". Similarly, the rightmost tall rectangle that is red and represents "own" has been divided into a lower rectangle for "joint" and an upper portion for "individual" application types. The benefit of this plot is that we can now get a sense of the proportional makeup of each homeownership category by looking at the relative widths of the three different colored tall rectangles, and we can also look at where each of these tall rectangles is broken into joint and individual applications. In this case, the tall rectangle for rent is broken lower than the mortgage and own levels, indicating it has fewer of the "joint" application types (which if you recall, was the lower sub-divided rectangles). The "own" category also has its horizontal break a bit lower than the "mortgage" rectangle's break, implying the mortgage category has the highest proportion of joint applications of the rent, mortgage, and own homeownership categories.]

> 2090:   \Figure[There are two figures shown: a side-by-side box plot on the left, and a two overlaid hollow histograms on the right. These two plots describe the same data for the "county" data set: a numerical variable for median household income and a categorical variable with levels of "gain" and "no gain" for the population change in the county. First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000. Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

These two plots describe the same data for the "county" data set: a numerical variable for median household income and a categorical variable with levels of "gain" and "no gain" for the population change in the county. First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000. Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked.

First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000. Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

These two plots describe the same data for the "county" data set: a numerical variable for median household income and a categorical variable with levels of "gain" and "no gain" for the population change in the county. First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000.

These two plots describe the same data for the "county" data set: a numerical variable for median household income and a categorical variable with levels of "gain" and "no gain" for the population change in the county. First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000. Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way.

Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

These two plots describe the same data for the "county" data set: a numerical variable for median household income and a categorical variable with levels of "gain" and "no gain" for the population change in the county. First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000. Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000.

> 2090:   \Figure[There are two figures shown: a side-by-side box plot on the left, and a two overlaid hollow histograms on the right. These two plots describe the same data for the "county" data set: a numerical variable for median household income and a categorical variable with levels of "gain" and "no gain" for the population change in the county. First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000. Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000. On the other hand, the "gain" group shows a slow but steady decline from about 30\% of its peak at \$70,000 down to close to the horizontal axis at \$100,000. The "gain" category bumps up just a tiny amount between \$100,000 and \$130,000 before becoming indistinguishable from the horizontal axis.]

> 2090:   \Figure[There are two figures shown: a side-by-side box plot on the left, and a two overlaid hollow histograms on the right. These two plots describe the same data for the "county" data set: a numerical variable for median household income and a categorical variable with levels of "gain" and "no gain" for the population change in the county. First, the side-by-side box plots shown as the left plot are described. This plot shows two box plots side-by-side, enclosed in the same general plot so they are close and so easier to compare. The left box plot represents "gain", and the right plot represents "no gain". The vertical axis runs from about \$20,000 to about \$130,000. Starting at the lower levels, the "no gain" lower whisker is at about \$20,000, while the "gain" lower whisker starts at about \$25,000. Each whisker runs upwards to the box, where the "no gain" box is reached first at about \$40,000 and the "gain" box at about \$47,000. The median line in each box is shown, where the "no gain" median is shown to at about \$45,000, even lower than the start of the "gain" box". The "gain" box's median is at about \$53,000 and is above the top of the "no gain box" at about \$52,000. The left "gain" box finally ends at about \$62,000. Above each box is the upper whisker. The upper whisker in the "gain" box plot extends far above that of the "no gain" box, reaching about \$87,000 vs \$70,000. Each box plot has many individual observations shown above the upper whisker. The largest outlier for "gain" is about \$130,000, and the largest outlier for "no gain" is about \$112,000. Next, moving onto the right plot of the two hollow histograms for the "gain" (in blue) and "no gain" (in red) categories. The hollow histograms are overlaid, making it easier to compare their shapes more directly. The histograms share a horizontal axis that runs from about \$20,000 up to about \$130,000. In each case, the histograms do not show the bins explicitly and instead only show the top portion of each histogram (hence the term "hollow histogram"), meaning each hollow histogram is described by a line outlining the top of each bin in each histogram. It is these lines that will be described. Starting at the left of the histograms, the "no gain" histogram line rises up slightly at \$20,000 before the "gain" histogram line starts rising starting at about \$25,000. The "no gain" line then ascends rapidly starting at about \$30,000, followed by the "gain" line ascending rapidly at about \$40,000, which is also about where the "no gain" category reaches a peak and holds steady until about \$50,000, which is also where the "gain" line has now peaked. It is at this \$50,000 point that the "no gain" line falls rapidly from what had been a relatively steady peak between about \$35,000 to \$50,000, with the "gain" group also much more slowly starting to descend at about \$50,000. At close to \$70,000, the "no gain" group is nearly touching the horizontal axis, while the "gain" group has only descended about 70\% of the way. The "no gain" group hovers close to horizontal axis until appearing indistinguishable from the horizontal axis a bit above \$90,000.
