   421: For example, it's common to require 4-byte types to be aligned to 4-byte boundaries and 8-byte types on 8-byte boundaries.
   422: If multi-byte primitives are stored on an unreasonable boundary, the performance can be significantly impacted because it may require an additional memory read.
>  423: On some architectures the penalty is even greater - the program will crash with a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_error\#Unaligned_access}{bus error}.
   424: Most of you have experienced this in your architecture classes if there was no memory protection.

  1748:     \Figuress[A side-by-side bar plot is shown. In this side-by-side plot, instead of having the blue and yellow portions of a single bar for a homeownership level, such as rent, the bar has been slimmed down and the blue and yellow portions are now side-by-side, each resting on the horizontal axis. Reading across, we see a blue and yellow bar side-by-side and touching. These are shown over a homeownership category of "rent". The first of these two bars is blue for "individual" application type (having a height of about 3500) and the second is yellow for the "joint" application type (having a height of about 400). After this first group of two bars, there is a small horizontal gap before the next pair of bars that represent the mortgage homeownership category. Here again, there is first a blue bar for individual application type, where this blue bar stretches up to a value of about 3900, and next to it is a yellow bar for the joint application type, which stretches up to about 800. After this second pair of bars, there is a little more space as we move right along the plot before we reach the "own" homeownership category, which shows another pair of bars: blue (with a bar reaching a frequency or count of about 1100) and yellow (with a bar reaching a value of about 200).]

  1896:     \Figures[A one-variable mosaic plot is shown for the homeownership variable, which has levels rent, mortgage, and own. A one-variable mosaic plot can first be pictured as a square that has partitions running vertically, breaking that square up into three pieces, one piece per level. The portion of the square assigned to each piece is proportional to the number of cases for each level. In this particular mosaic plot, we see a "rent" piece on the left portion of the square that has been colored green -- this tall rectangle represents about 40\% of the square. Now considering the middle tall rectangle, which is blue and has been labeled as "mortgage", its width is close to half of the total width of the square. The rightmost tall rectangle is red and is labeled "own", and it appears to represent a little more than 10\% of the total width of the rectangle.]

  1903:     \Figures[A two-variable mosaic plot is shown, partitioned with vertical slices first for the homeownership variable in the same way as a one-variable mosaic plot, and then each of the tall rectangle from that one-variable mosaic plot has been sliced horizontally to represent the application types individual (shown as the upper portion of each tall rectangle) and joint (shown as the lower portion of each tall rectangle). Taking the first tall rectangle on the left of the mosaic plot, which is green and labeled as "rent", it is divided into a small "joint" rectangle at the bottom of the "rent" rectangle and a much larger upper portion that represents the "individual" application types of the rent homeownership cases. This same partitioning is repeated for the tall middle rectangle representing the blue mortgage homeownership cases, where a small portion of those applications are broken off into a smaller rectangle on the bottom for "joint" and a larger rectangle for the cases that are "individual". Similarly, the rightmost tall rectangle that is red and represents "own" has been divided into a lower rectangle for "joint" and an upper portion for "individual" application types. The benefit of this plot is that we can now get a sense of the proportional makeup of each homeownership category by looking at the relative widths of the three different colored tall rectangles, and we can also look at where each of these tall rectangles is broken into joint and individual applications. In this case, the tall rectangle for rent is broken lower than the mortgage and own levels, indicating it has fewer of the "joint" application types (which if you recall, was the lower sub-divided rectangles). The "own" category also has its horizontal break a bit lower than the "mortgage" rectangle's break, implying the mortgage category has the highest proportion of joint applications of the rent, mortgage, and own homeownership categories.]

Suppose there are $N$ skills and $s_i$ denotes the success rate of the model at correctly applying the $i$th skill. Then, its $X$ value should reflect the average\footnote{With perhaps a small correction factor if the skills are not evenly distributed among the questions} of the $s_i$'s. Furthermore, on a random question using the $i$th and $j$th skill, the probability that the model correctly answers it should be  $s_i s_j$, since it has to successfully apply both skills.

   835:     \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Judgement:}} The reformulated problem is a direct and clear request to find the sum of the prime factors of 2010. It does not provide any multiple-choice options, nor does it limit the answer choices in any way. The problem requires the solver to find the prime factorization of 2010 and then sum the prime factors, which is a well-defined mathematical task.\\The original problem and the reformulated problem are mathematically equivalent, and the solution to the original problem is still applicable to the reformulated problem. The reformulated problem does not introduce any new mathematical concepts or difficulties, and it does not provide any additional information that would make the problem easier to solve.\\The answer format specification is clear and unambiguous, requiring the solver to express the answer as a single integer. This is a suitable format for the problem, as the sum of the prime factors is a well-defined integer value.\\Overall, the reformulated problem is a well-posed and mathematically sound problem that requires the solver to apply mathematical concepts and techniques to find the solution.\\
