Equation terms which are entered into the query box are all considered to be part of a single equation: multiple equations can not be searched for \footnote{This was found from experimentation.  Specifically, a paper was found which contained at least two equations, and the two equations were searched for independently (to make sure they were found) and then together, in the format (without the \textlangle \  \textrangle \  brackets): \textlangle \ ``equation1'' AND ``equation2'' \  \textrangle \  When they were searched for together, no results were found.  Searching for pieces of a single equation, in the format \textlangle \ ``piece1'' AND ``piece2'' \ \textrangle, does work to bring up individual equations which contain both pieces.}.  Advanced search options allow subject, publication, and year to be added to the equation search. \cite{LaTeXSearch-search-page}  Alternatively, a single article's equations can all be recalled by entering the DOI or title keywords of that publication.  \cite{Springer-LatexSearch-post}

>  158: Meaning-based search is used: equations are parsed for comparisons using \emph{Mathematica}.  The ``Simplify'' and ``FullSimplify'' commands, in Mathmatica, are used to normalize every equation in the database, and every query, so that they can be compared based on their mathematical meaning rather than their syntax (or ``presentation''). \cite{Oviedo-Th, Oviedo-5e-2pg}.  These commands in \emph{Mathematica} can re-arrange the equations to a standardized form, using special function definitions, elementary function definitions, and of course simple rules including associativity and distributivity (which the other search engines only approximate).  \footnote{Another, currently-available math-aware search engine is investigating including \emph{Mathematica}-like systems for performing the mathematical comparisons: MIaS, which has its present state discussed in sections \ref{sec:MIaS-meaning-abilities} and \ref{sec:MIaS-descrip-Avail-engines}. \cite{Liska-PhD-Prop}}

>  106: Variable names can either be preserved (for ``non-query'' variables) or ignored (for \linebreak ``query'', or ``wildcard'' variables). \cite{MWS-thesis-hasegan} This means that a user can enforce commutativity to hold (although it may be encoded into MathWebSearch already - the literature does not mention commutativity) simply by writing their equation using query variables. It supports the use of ``named'' query variables, so that a user can specify both that certain variables should have the same name (as in $ab + a$) and that the actual variable used is irrelevant (so $xy + x$ would also match) \cite{MWS-0.5-fgwm, zbMATH-search-page}. Based upon experimentation with zbMATH \cite{zbMATH-engine}, query variables in MWS are allowed to be replaced with subscripted variables, non-subscript variables, or numbers: $(?x)^2 + (?y)^2$ can retrieve $a^2+b^2$, $x_1^2 + x_2^2$, and $8^1 + 1^2$. Furthermore, when non-query variables are used, the variable names are not allowed to vary at all \footnote{To test whether non-query variables were allowed to vary, the expression ``c\textasciicircum{}2 + d\textasciicircum{}2'' was searched on zbMATH's formula-oriented search page, \cite{zbMATH-engine}. Only two pages of results were found, all of which used exactly the formula $c^2 + d^2$. However, searching for the query variable form of this equation, ``(?c)\textasciicircum{}2 + (?d)\textasciicircum{}2'', brought up 497 results, which included those using variables other than ``c'' and ``d''; examples included $x_1^2 + x_2^2$, $x^2 + y^2$, and $8^2 + 1^2$.}.

LEAN can check whether the generated formal proof completes the statement's goals. We compare InternLM2-Math-Base with other pre-trained language models in Table~\ref{table:minif2f}. InternLM2-Math-7B-Base solves 74 of 244 problems and achieves 30.3 which yields a new state-of-the-art performance. InternLM2-Math-7B-Base and InternLM2-Math-20B-Base find 25 and 24 new proofs respectively which do not appear in the official MiniF2F repository \footnote{\url{https://github.com/openai/miniF2F/blob/main/LEAN/src/test.LEAN}}. Like \cite{gloeckle2023temperature,llemma}, we do not find the formal reasoning performances scale with model parameter sizes. We leave it to the future work of how data and parameter sizes influence formal reasoning performances.
